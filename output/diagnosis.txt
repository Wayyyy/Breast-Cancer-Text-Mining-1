TI  - MicroRNA-145 inhibits growth and migration of breast cancer cells through
      targeting oncoprotein ROCK1.
PG  - 8189-96

AB  - MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that may also function as oncogenes and tumor
      suppressor genes, as the abnormal expression of microRNAs is associated with
      various human tumors. MicroRNA-145 (miR-145) inhibits growth and increases chemo-
      or radiosensitivity in various cancers. However, the role of miR-145 in breast
      cancer progression remains unknown. In this study, miR-145 expression level was
      measured via quantitative real-time PCR in 88 pairs of human breast cancer
      tissues and adjacent normal tissues and in a panel of human breast cancer cell
      lines. Cell proliferation and cell migration were assessed by cell viability
      assay and transwell assay. Western blot was used to verify Rho-associated protein
      kinase 1 (ROCK1) as a novel target gene of miR-145. Our results showed that
      miR-145 was frequently downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines.
      Overexpression of miR-145 in MCF-7 and BT-549 cell lines significantly inhibited 
      cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. ROCK1 was identified as a
      target of miR-145, and ectopic expression of miR-145 downregulated ROCK1. Our
      findings indicate that miR-145 acts as a tumor suppressor and its downregulation 
      in tumor tissues may contribute to the progression of breast cancer through a
      mechanism involving ROCK1, suggesting miR-145 as a potential new diagnostic and
      therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - [Clinical efficacy and safety of trastuzumab plus capecitabine as first-line
      therapy for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer].
PG  - 2796-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab plus capecitabine
      as first-line therapy for HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients who
      have previously received anthracyclines and taxanes. METHODS: The patients who
      have HER-2-positive breast cancer recurrence and metastasis after treated by
      anthracyclines and taxanes were enrolled in this study. The patients received
      trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 21 days following a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on cycle
      1) and capecitabine (2 000 mg/m(2), days 1 to 14 every 21 days). RESULTS: 38
      patients were enrolled. The median PFS for trastuzumab plus capecitabine was 8.6 
      months. The objective response rate (ORR) was 31.6%. Clinical benefit rate (CBR) 
      was 65.8%. The most serious adverse event was leucopenia in one patient.
      Relatively common hematology toxicity was grade I or II leucopenia and
      neutropenia. The most common nonhematologic toxicity was hand-foot syndrome
      (HFS), which observed in 8 patients (21%). The morbidity of grade II and III HFS 
      were 8% and 3% respectively. CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab plus capecitabine is an
      effective and safe regimen as first-line treatment for HER-2-positive metastatic 
      breast cancer patients whose cancer is resistant to treatment with anthracyclines
      and taxanes.

TI  - Heat shock protein 27 and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 play critical
      roles in molecular apocrine breast cancer.
PG  - 8027-36
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-4712-4 [doi]
AB  - Molecular apocrine breast cancer (MABC) has a distinct hormonal profile, being
      estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative but androgen
      receptor (AR) positive. The clinical significance of MABC and its relative
      variables have not been absolutely clarified and remain to be determined. Five
      hundred cases of invasive breast carcinoma were randomly selected in this study, 
      including 158 MABC cases and 342 nonMABC cases. Expression of ER, PR, epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), Ki67, AR, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 
      (GCDFP15), and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) were analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry. Differences of continuous variables between MABC and
      nonMABC subgroups were evaluated by the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method 
      was performed to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). 
      The MABC subgroup had higher histological grade, bigger tumor size, more lymph
      node metastasis, and higher pTNM stage than the nonMABC subgroup (P < 0.05), and 
      patients with MABC had poorer prognosis than those of the nonMABC subgroup (P <
      0.05). Both GCDFP15 and HSP27 were expressed differently in the MABC and nonMABC 
      subgroups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the MABC subgroup, positive HSP27
      expression indicated higher risk of recurrence (P < 0.05) and positive GCDFP15
      expression was also a poor marker for patient outcome (P < 0.05). MABC patients
      with HSP27 and GCDFP15 co-expression had worse outcome (P < 0.05). Our data
      suggested that MABC had a high risk of recurrence. Positive expression of both
      GCDFP15 and HSP27 were correlated with MABC malignancy. Targeting AR and HSP27 at
      the same time might offer a useful strategy to MABC.

PG  - 2264-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the indexes related to the efficacy of lapatinib after
      failure in trastuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) such as
      the status of PTEN, p-4EBP1 and clinical features. METHODS: Sixtymatched patients
      were included. Immunohistochemical (IHC) test of tissue specimens of metastatic
      lesions were applied to determine the status of PTEN and p-4EBP1. The correlation
      betweenclinical efficacy andthestatus of PTEN, p-4EBP1 and clinical features were
      analysed by long-rank test and Cox regression. RESULTS: In all patients,
      themedian progression free survival (PFS), ORR and CBR was 4.6 months, 36.7% and 
      50.0% respectively.Univariate analysis revealed that lapatinib-treated patients
      with PTEN loss (P = 0.015) and liver metastasis (P = 0.02) had significantly
      shorter median PFS. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with PTEN
      lossandliver metastasis had higher risk of diseaseprogression (P = 0.005, 0.006, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: HER2-positive MBC with trastuzumab-resistance could
      benefit from lapatinib regimen. PTEN statusand liver metastasis couldpredict
      theclinical efficacyof subsequent lapatinib therapy. The detection ofrelated
      biomarkers could provide some referenceto optimize the personal treatment with
      HER2-positive breast cancer.

PG  - 1910-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antitumor effects of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in
      breast cancer stem cells and total cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In vitro 
      studies, we sorted ESA(+) CD44(+) CD24(-/low) cells as stem cells using flow
      cytometry from primary breast cancer cells. Apoptosis and the cell cycle
      distributions of stem cells were examined by flow cytometry. The tumorigenicity
      of stem cells after treatment was investigated by soft agar colony formation
      assays. BALB/c mice were injected with stem cells and the different treatments
      were administered. After necropsy, the expression of Ki67, CD31, AKT1, and
      phospho-AKT (Thr308) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Treatment
      with everolimus resulted in growth inhibition of all stem cells in a
      dose-dependent manner. An increase in G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and an increased
      population of cells in early apoptosis were seen in everolimus treatment. In
      vivo, the volumes of the xenograft tumors significantly decreased in everolimus
      alone group compared to control group. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus could inhibit the 
      growth of both total breast cancer cells and sorted stem cells in vitro and in
      vivo.

AB  - This retrospective analysis conducted using data from patients enrolled onto the 
      Herceptin Adjuvant has two objectives: The first is to evaluate the impact of the
      time interval between the end of adjuvant trastuzumab and distant recurrence
      (TDRI) upon overall survival (OS). The second is to describe the duration of
      trastuzumab-based regimens in the metastatic setting for patients previously
      treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. The first objective included 187 patients
      treated with adjuvant trastuzumab and diagnosed with distant recurrence at 4-year
      median follow-up. The second objective included data from questionnaires sent to 
      investigators retreating patients with trastuzumab upon distant recurrence: 144
      of 156 questionnaires were returned (93 %), and 90 patients were selected based
      on available clinical information and consent for subsequent studies. There was
      no statistically significant relationship between TDRI following 1 year of
      adjuvant trastuzumab and OS from distant recurrence: hazard ratio 0.991, p =
      0.46. The median OS from distant recurrence was numerically longer among patients
      with a TDRI of >/=12 months (n = 103) than <12 months (n = 84) but not
      statistically significant (23.7 vs. 17.8 months, p = 0.47). The median duration
      of first-line trastuzumab-based regimens for patients previously treated with
      adjuvant trastuzumab and diagnosed with distant disease recurrence was 8.8 months
      (n = 88). This retrospective, exploratory study suggests that TDRI did not impact
      on OS measured from distant recurrence. We argue that prospective collection of
      treatment information beyond disease progression should be included in future
      clinical studies.

TI  - Plasma hyaluronic acid level as a prognostic and monitoring marker of metastatic 
      breast cancer.
PG  - 2499-509
LID - 10.1002/ijc.29975 [doi]
AB  - Conventional tumor markers have limited value for prognostication and treatment
      monitoring in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and novel circulating tumor
      markers therefore need to be explored. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major
      macropolysaccharide in the extracellular matrix and is reported to be associated 
      with tumor progression. In our study, we investigated plasma HA level with
      respect to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as 
      the treatment monitoring value in MBC patients. The prognostic value of plasma HA
      level was investigated in a discovery cohort of 212 MBC patients with 2.5-year
      follow-up and validated in an independent validation cohort of 334 patients with 
      5-year follow-up. The treatment monitoring value of plasma HA level was
      investigated in 61 MBC patients from discovery cohort who had been
      radiographically examined after first complete cycle of chemo therapy. We found a
      robust association between high plasma HA level and poor prognosis of MBC
      patients in both discovery (pPFS = 7.92 x 10(-6) and pOS = 5.27 x 10(-5)) and
      validation studies (pPFS = 3.66 x 10(-4) and pOS = 1.43 x 10(-4)). In the
      discovery cohort, the plasma HA level displayed independent prognostic value
      after adjusted for age and clinicopathological factors, with respect to PFS and
      OS. Further, the decrease of plasma HA level displayed good concordance with
      treatment response evaluated by radiographic examination (AUC = 0.79). Plasma HA 
      level displays prognostic value, as well as treatment monitoring value for MBC
      patients.

TI  - Low expression of BMPRIB indicates poor prognosis of breast cancer and is
      insensitive to taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy.
PG  - 4770-84
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.6613 [doi]
AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB (BMPRIB) is one osteogenesis factor, 
      which function in breast cancer has been rarely explored until recently. In the
      clinical study presented here, involving a cohort of 368 invasive ductal
      carcinoma (IDC) patients, we identified that patients with low expression of
      BMPRIB exhibited poor prognosis, especially in the luminal B subtype. We also
      provided the first piece of evidence that low level of BMPRIB was a promoting
      factor for breast cancer patients to develop bone metastasis, but not lung, liver
      or brain. The first of its kind, we reported that patients with high expression
      of BMPRIB exhibited favorable prognosis by a retrospective analysis consisting of
      168 patients treated with TE (taxane and anthracycline) regimens. And the
      patients with high expression of BMPRIB were more sensitive to TE regimens in the
      detection of 32 paired pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant specimens. Overall,
      our study concluded that low expression of BMPRIB indicated poor prognosis of
      breast cancer and was insensitive to taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy. Our
      findings also lay a foundation to help clinicians improve identification of
      patients for TE regimens by BMPRIB in the era of precision medicine.

TI  - Heterogeneity of luminal breast cancer characterised by immunohistochemical
      expression of basal markers.
PG  - 298-304
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2015.437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Luminal A breast cancer defined as hormone receptor positive and
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative is known to be
      heterogeneous. Previous study showed that luminal A tumours with the expression
      of basal markers ((cytokeratin (CK) 5 or CK5/6) or epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR)) were associated with poorer prognosis compared with those that
      stained negative for basal markers. Prompted by this study, we assessed whether
      tumour characteristics and risk factors differed by basal marker status within
      luminal A tumours. METHODS: We pooled 5040 luminal A cases defined by
      immunohistochemistry (4490 basal-negative ((CK5 (or CK5/6))- and EGFR-) and 550
      basal-positive ((CK5 (or CK5/6+)) or EGFR+)) from eight studies participating in 
      the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Case-case comparison was performed
      using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Tumour characteristics and risk
      factors did not vary significantly by the expression of basal markers, although
      results suggested that basal-positive luminal tumours tended to be smaller and
      node negative, and were more common in women with a positive family history and
      lower body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Most established breast cancer risk factors
      were similar in basal-positive and basal-negative luminal A tumours. The
      non-significant but suggestive differences in tumour features and family history 
      warrant further investigations.

TI  - Variants in 6q25.1 Are Associated with Mammographic Density in Malaysian Chinese 
      Women.
PG  - 327-33
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0746 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mammographic density is an established risk factor for breast cancer 
      and has a strong heritable component. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 
      mammographic density conducted in women of European descent have identified
      several genetic associations, but none of the studies have been tested in Asians.
      We sought to investigate whether these genetic loci, and loci associated with
      breast cancer risk and breast size, are associated with mammographic density in
      an Asian cohort. METHODS: We conducted genotyping by mass spectrometry in 1,189
      women (865 Chinese, 187 Indian, and 137 Malay). Quantitative measurements of
      mammographic density were performed using ImageJ, a fully automated thresholding 
      technique. The associations of SNPs to densities were analyzed using linear
      regression models. RESULTS: We successfully evaluated the associations of 36 SNPs
      with mammographic densities. After adjusting for age, body mass index, parity,
      and menopausal status, we found that in our cohort of 865 Malaysian Chinese,
      three SNPs in the 6q25.1 region near ESR1 (rs2046210, rs12173570, and rs10484919)
      that were associated with mammographic density, breast cancer risk, or breast
      size in previous GWAS were significantly associated with both percentage density 
      and absolute dense area. We could not replicate the most significant association 
      found previously in European women (rs10995190, ZNF365 gene) because the minor
      allele was absent for Asian women. CONCLUSION: We found that the directions of
      genetic associations were similar to those reported in Caucasian women. IMPACT:
      Our results show that even in Asian women with lower population risk to breast
      cancer, there is shared heritability between mammographic density and breast
      cancer risk.

TI  - Incidence and relapse risk of intracranial metastases within the perihippocampal 
      region in 314 patients with breast cancer.
PG  - 181-6
LID - 10.1016/j.radonc.2015.11.010 [doi]

AB  - PURPOSE: The safe prerequisite of hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy
      (HS-WBRT) for patients with breast cancer is unclear. This study investigated the
      risk and relapse of perihippocampal (PH) metastases in breast cancer. METHODS:
      Consecutive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis (BM) were reviewed.
      Metastases and hippocampi were contoured in cranial magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). The closest distance from metastasis to hippocampus was calculated.
      Clinical and radiographic variables were correlated with PH (in or within 5mm
      around the hippocampus) metastasis. The risk of post-treatment PH recurrence was 
      estimated. RESULTS: Three hundred and fourteen patients with 1678 metastases
      exhibited a median breast cancer-specific overall survival (OS) and OS after BM
      (BMOS) of 75.4 and 14.3 months, respectively. Hippocampal metastases were
      identified in 1.2% of metastases and 4.1% of patients. PH lesions comprised 3.5% 
      of lesions in 11.1% of patients. The number and aggregated volume of BM were
      associated with PH disease probability (univariate). Only the number of BM
      significantly correlated with PH disease in the multivariate analysis. The
      patients with PH lesions exhibited more non-oligometastatic disease, increased
      tumor volume, and poor BMOS. One hundred and eleven patients without original PH 
      lesions developed intracranial progression post-treatment. The risks of PH
      metastasis recurrence were 4.6% for WBRT and 6.8% for sub-therapeutic irradiation
      in the PH region. The increase in the absolute risk of PH recurrence with
      hippocampal-sparing irradiation was approximately 2%. CONCLUSIONS: These novel
      findings indicate that BM from breast cancer exhibits low risks of metastases and
      relapse within the hippocampal avoidance region. Non-oligometastatic disease is
      associated with PH metastasis. Thus, HS-WBRT is considered safe and suitable for 
      breast cancer.

TI  - A polymorphism in the base excision repair gene PARP2 is associated with
      differential prognosis by chemotherapy among postmenopausal breast cancer
      patients.
PG  - 978
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1957-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalized therapy considering clinical and genetic patient
      characteristics will further improve breast cancer survival. Two widely used
      treatments, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can induce oxidative DNA damage and,
      if not repaired, cell death. Since base excision repair (BER) activity is
      specific for oxidative DNA damage, we hypothesized that germline genetic
      variation in this pathway will affect breast cancer-specific survival depending
      on treatment. METHODS: We assessed in 1,408 postmenopausal breast cancer patients
      from the German MARIE study whether cancer specific survival after adjuvant
      chemotherapy, anthracycline chemotherapy, and radiotherapy is modulated by 127
      Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 BER genes. For SNPs with interaction
      terms showing p<0.1 (likelihood ratio test) using multivariable Cox proportional 
      hazard analyses, replication in 6,392 patients from nine studies of the Breast
      Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) was performed. RESULTS: rs878156 in PARP2
      showed a differential effect by chemotherapy (p=0.093) and was replicated in BCAC
      studies (p=0.009; combined analysis p=0.002). Compared to non-carriers, carriers 
      of the variant G allele (minor allele frequency=0.07) showed better survival
      after chemotherapy (combined allelic hazard ratio (HR)=0.75, 95% 0.53-1.07) and
      poorer survival when not treated with chemotherapy (HR=1.42, 95% 1.08-1.85). A
      similar effect modification by rs878156 was observed for anthracycline-based
      chemotherapy in both MARIE and BCAC, with improved survival in carriers (combined
      allelic HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.40-1.32). None of the SNPs showed significant
      differential effects by radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest for the first
      time that a SNP in PARP2, rs878156, may together with other genetic variants
      modulate cancer specific survival in breast cancer patients depending on
      chemotherapy. These germline SNPs could contribute towards the design of
      predictive tests for breast cancer patients.

TI  - Cervical cancer control in Latin America: A call to action.
PG  - 502-14
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29813 [doi]
AB  - Cervical cancer (CC) is second most common cause of cancer in Latin America and
      is a leading cause of cancer mortality among women. In 2015, an estimated 74,488 
      women will be diagnosed with CC in Latin America and 31,303 will die of the
      disease. CC mortality is projected to increase by 45% by 2030 despite human
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and screening efforts. In this setting, the goal
      was of the current study was to examine CC control efforts in Latin America and
      identify deficiencies in these efforts that could be addressed to reduce CC
      incidence and mortality. The authors found that HPV vaccination has been
      introduced in the majority of Latin American countries, and there is now a need
      to monitor the success (or shortcomings) of these programs and to ensure that
      these programs are sustainable. This topic was also reviewed in light of emerging
      data demonstrating that visual inspection with acetic acid and HPV DNA testing
      without Papanicolaou tests have efficacy from a screening perspective and are
      good alternatives to cytology-based screening programs. Overall, there is a need 
      to build capacity for CC control in Latin America and the best strategy will
      depend on the country/region and must be tailored to meet the needs of the
      population as well as available resources.

TI  - The Clinical Significance and Molecular Features of the Spatial Tumor Shapes in
      Breast Cancers.
PG  - e0143811
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0143811 [doi]
AB  - Each breast cancer has its unique spatial shape, but the clinical importance and 
      the underlying mechanism for the three-dimensional tumor shapes are mostly
      unknown. We collected the data on the three-dimensional tumor size and tumor
      volume data of invasive breast cancers from 2,250 patients who underwent surgery 
      between Jan 2000 and Jul 2007. The degree of tumor eccentricity was estimated by 
      using the difference between the spheroid tumor volume and ellipsoid tumor volume
      (spheroid-ellipsoid discrepancy, SED). In 41 patients, transcriptome and exome
      sequencing data obtained. Estimation of more accurate tumor burden by calculating
      ellipsoid tumor volumes did not improve the outcome prediction when compared to
      the traditional longest diameter measurement. However, the spatial tumor
      eccentricity, which was measured by SED, showed significant variation between the
      molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Additionally, the degree of tumor
      eccentricity was associated with well-known prognostic factors of breast cancer
      such as tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Transcriptome data from 41 patients
      showed significant association between MMP13 and spatial tumor shapes. Network
      analysis and analysis of TCGA gene expression data suggest that MMP13 is
      regulated by ERBB2 and S100A7A. The present study validates the usefulness of the
      current tumor size method in determining tumor stages. Furthermore, we show that 
      the tumors with high eccentricity are more likely to have aggressive tumor
      characteristics. Genes involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling can be
      candidate regulators of the spatial tumor shapes in breast cancer.

AB  - The clinical relevance of the host immune system in breast cancer has long been

      biological heterogeneity of breast cancer, prompting researchers to investigate
      whether the role of the immune system in this malignancy is similar across
      different molecular subtypes of the disease. The presence of high levels of
      lymphocytic infiltration has been consistently associated with a more-favourable 
      prognosis in patients with early stage triple-negative and HER2-positive breast
      cancer. These infiltrates seem to reflect favourable host antitumour immune
      responses, suggesting that immune activation is important for improving survival 
      outcomes. In this Review, we discuss the composition of the immune infiltrates
      observed in breast cancers, as well as data supporting the clinical relevance of 
      host antitumour immunity, as represented by lymphocytic infiltration, and how
      this biomarker could be used in the clinical setting. We also discuss the
      rationale for enhancing immunity in breast cancer, including early data on the
      efficacy of T-cell checkpoint inhibition in this setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of recurrence improves the survival rate of patients 
      treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT). Therefore, ultrasonography (US)
      may be useful for metachronous ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (MIBTR)
      obscured on mammography by dense breast tissue and distortion. PURPOSE: To
      evaluate clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings of MIBTR retrospectively, 
      and to assess the role of surveillance US additional to mammography for MIBTR
      detection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 2000 to 2012, 28 MIBTR were collected and
      reviewed among 2958 women treated for primary breast cancer with conservation
      surgery. The detection rates of imaging studies for identifying metachronous
      ipsilateral lesions were assessed and compared. MIBTR tumor staging was evaluated
      according to imaging modality for detection of MIBTR, palpability, and recent
      imaging surveillance. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the
      detection rate between mammography and US for overall MIBTR (84.2% vs. 85.7%; P =
      0.898) or non-palpable MIBTR (88.2% vs. 81.0%; P = 0.566). US alone identified
      33.3% of non-palpable MIBTRs (seven of 21). Among these cases, two had negative
      mammograms. All 14 MIBTRs with recent imaging surveillance were stage T2 or less,
      and all seven MIBTRs detected by US alone were in situ or T1; 33% of MIBTRs
      without recent imaging surveillance were T3 or T4. CONCLUSION: The overall MIBTR 
      detection rate by US was not higher than the detection rate of mammography,
      although combined surveillance with US and mammography found MIBTRs slightly
      earlier than mammography alone.

TI  - Systematic review of axillary reverse mapping in breast cancer.
PG  - 170-8
LID - 10.1002/bjs.10041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) assesses the lymphatic drainage of the
      arm simultaneously with that of the breast, enabling preservation of arm
      lymphatics during axillary surgery for breast cancer. This article systematically
      reviews the evidence on the lymphoedema rate and oncological safety of the ARM
      technique. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched
      systematically for studies that addressed the use of ARM during axillary surgery 
      in breast cancer. Studies were eligible if they performed ARM during sentinel
      node biopsy (SNB) or axillary node clearance (ANC) for breast cancer in
      prospective studies of more than 50 patients, with assessment of lymphoedema and 
      oncological outcomes during a minimum follow-up of 6 months. RESULTS: Eight
      studies reported data on ARM in 1142 patients undergoing axillary surgery for
      breast cancer. Lymphoedema rates ranged from 0 to 6 per cent during ARM-assisted 
      SNB, and from 5.9 to 24 per cent during ARM lymphatic preservation at ANC.
      Crossover nodes between the arm and breast lymphatics were identified in 0-10 per
      cent of patients, and metastases were present in 0-20 per cent of these patients.
      ARM nodes were not preserved in between 11 and 18 per cent of patients with ARM
      nodes identified, and metastases were detected in 0-19 per cent of these
      patients. CONCLUSION: ARM can achieve low rates of lymphoedema, but the risk of
      metastasis in crossover and clinically suspicious ARM nodes, or those in close
      proximity to an involved sentinel node, warrants their excision.

TI  - Oxygen-Enhanced MRI Accurately Identifies, Quantifies, and Maps Tumor Hypoxia in 
      Preclinical Cancer Models.
PG  - 787-95
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2062 [doi]
AB  - There is a clinical need for noninvasive biomarkers of tumor hypoxia for
      prognostic and predictive studies, radiotherapy planning, and therapy monitoring.
      Oxygen-enhanced MRI (OE-MRI) is an emerging imaging technique for quantifying the
      spatial distribution and extent of tumor oxygen delivery in vivo. In OE-MRI, the 
      longitudinal relaxation rate of protons (DeltaR1) changes in proportion to the
      concentration of molecular oxygen dissolved in plasma or interstitial tissue
      fluid. Therefore, well-oxygenated tissues show positive DeltaR1. We hypothesized 
      that the fraction of tumor tissue refractory to oxygen challenge (lack of
      positive DeltaR1, termed "Oxy-R fraction") would be a robust biomarker of hypoxia
      in models with varying vascular and hypoxic features. Here, we demonstrate that
      OE-MRI signals are accurate, precise, and sensitive to changes in tumor pO2 in
      highly vascular 786-0 renal cancer xenografts. Furthermore, we show that Oxy-R
      fraction can quantify the hypoxic fraction in multiple models with differing
      hypoxic and vascular phenotypes, when used in combination with measurements of
      tumor perfusion. Finally, Oxy-R fraction can detect dynamic changes in hypoxia
      induced by the vasomodulator agent hydralazine. In contrast, more conventional
      biomarkers of hypoxia (derived from blood oxygenation-level dependent MRI and
      dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) did not relate to tumor hypoxia consistently. Our 
      results show that the Oxy-R fraction accurately quantifies tumor hypoxia
      noninvasively and is immediately translatable to the clinic.

TI  - High HER2/Centromeric Probe for Chromosome 17 Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization 
      Ratio Predicts Pathologic Complete Response and Survival Outcome in Patients
      Receiving Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy With Trastuzumab for HER2-Overexpressing
      Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.
PG  - 21-7
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study was performed to determine whether the human
      epidermal growth factor receptor-related 2 (HER2)/centromeric probe for
      chromosome 17 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio is a predictor of a
      pathologic complete response (pCR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and/or
      overall survival (OS) in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) 
      with trastuzumab (NST-T) for HER2+ locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present retrospective study included 555 patients with 
      HER2+ LABC who had undergone NST and definitive surgery (1999-2012); 373 had
      concurrently received trastuzumab. HER2-positivity was considered present with an
      immunohistochemical score of 3+ and/or HER2 FISH ratio of >/=2.0. We used
      logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard modeling to determine
      whether a high HER2 FISH ratio, either as a continuous variable or with a cutoff 
      of >/=7.0, would predict for pCR (no invasive disease in the breast and no tumor 
      in the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes), RFS, and/or OS. RESULTS: The pCR
      group's median HER2 FISH ratio was significantly higher than that of the non-pCR 
      group (6.4 vs. 5.2; p = .003). The logistic regression model demonstrated that
      the independent predictors of pCR included a high HER2 FISH ratio as a continuous
      variable (p = .04). The multicovariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that 
      a high HER2 FISH ratio (with a cutoff of >/=7.0 or as a continuous variable) was 
      a significant prognostic indicator of longer RFS time (p = .047 and p = .04,
      respectively). Similarly, a high HER2 FISH ratio of >/=7.0 was associated with
      longer OS (p = .06). CONCLUSION: A high HER2 FISH ratio is a predictor of pCR in 
      patients with HER2+ LABC who receive NST-T. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study
      demonstrated the optimal predictive and prognostic value of a HER2/centromeric
      probe for chromosome 17 FISH ratio for primary HER2+ breast cancer treated with
      trastuzumab combined with neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST-T). This suggests
      that a high HER2 FISH ratio is a potential indicator for a high pathologic
      complete response rate and a better prognosis when patients are treated with
      NST-T.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of tumor growth rate, 
      calculated from tumor size measurements by US, on breast cancer patients'
      outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients who received at least two
      serial breast ultrasonographies (US) in our institution during preoperative
      period and were surgically treated between 2002 and 2010 were reviewed. Tumor
      growth rate was determined by specific growth rate (SGR) using the two time point
      tumor sizes by US. RESULTS: A total of 957 patients were analyzed. The median
      duration between initial and second US was 28 days (range, 8-140). The median
      initial tumor size was 1.7 cm (range, 0.4-7.0) and median second size was 1.9 cm 
      (range, 0.3-7.2). 523 (54.6%) cases had increase in size. The median SGR(x10-2)
      was 0.59 (range, -11.90~31.49) and mean tumor doubling time was 14.51 days. Tumor
      growth rate was higher when initial tumor size was smaller. Lymphovascular
      invasion, axillary lymph node metastasis, and higher histologic grade were
      significantly associated with higher SGR. SGR was significantly associated with
      disease-free survival (DFS) in a univariate analysis (p = 0.04), but not in a
      multivariate Cox analysis (p>0.05). High SGR was significantly associated with
      worse DFS in a subgroup of initial tumor size >2 cm (p = 0.018), but not in those
      with tumor size <2 cm (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that tumor growth 
      rate measured by US in a relatively short time interval was associated with other
      worse prognostic factors and DFS, but it was not an independent prognostic factor
      in breast cancer patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Black breast cancer survivors have high rates of obesity and low
      physical activity levels. Little is known about the acceptability and feasibility
      of interventions in this population. OBJECTIVE: A two-arm RCT was launched to
      assess the efficacy of a culturally targeted 12-week multimodal lifestyle
      intervention in overweight and obese black survivors. METHODS: Intervention
      components included nutrition education, exercise groups, and survivor-led
      motivational interviewing phone sessions. The analytic sample included women who 
      completed the trial (intervention n=10; control n=12). Anthropometric measures,
      physical activity, and VO2max were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Change
      scores (intervention vs. control) were assessed with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. A
      process evaluation assessed intervention acceptability. RESULTS: Overall
      adherence was 70% and overall satisfaction was high (86%). Despite the 5% weight 
      loss target, the intervention group lost 0.8% but BMI improved. Total physical
      activity levels increased in the intervention vs. control arm (+3501METmin/week
      vs. +965METmin/week, respectively). VO2max improved in the intervention group
      (+0.10+/-1.03kg/L/min). Intervention participants reduced energy intake
      (-207.3+/-31.5kcals) and showed improvements in fat intake (-15.5+/-3.8g), fiber 
      (+3.2+/-1.2g) and % energy from fat (-4.8+/-3.1%). Survivors suggested providing 
      diet/exercise information within a cancer context. CONCLUSIONS: Group and
      individualized intervention strategies are acceptable to black survivors.
      Observed differences between self-report and objective outcomes may suggest
      reporting bias or changes in body composition. Increasing supervised intervention
      components and assessment of body composition will be important for future
      trials.

TI  - c-Met PET Imaging Detects Early-Stage Locoregional Recurrence of Basal-Like
      Breast Cancer.
PG  - 765-70
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.115.164384 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Locoregional recurrence of breast cancer poses significant clinical
      problems because of frequent inoperability once the chest wall is involved. Early
      detection of recurrence by molecular imaging agents against therapeutically
      targetable receptors, such as c-Met, would be of potential benefit. The aim of
      this study was to assess (18)F-AH113804, a peptide-based molecular imaging agent 
      with high affinity for human c-Met, for the detection of early-stage locoregional
      recurrence in a human basal-like breast cancer model, HCC1954. METHODS: HCC1954
      tumor-bearing xenograft models were established, and (18)F-AH113804 was
      administered. Distribution of radioactivity was determined via PET at 60 min
      after radiotracer injection. PET and CT images were acquired 10 d after tumor
      inoculation, to establish baseline distribution and uptake, and then on selected 
      days after surgical tumor resection. CT images and caliper were used to determine
      the tumor volume. Radiotracer uptake was assessed by (18)F-AH113804 PET imaging. 
      c-Met expression was assessed by immunofluorescence imaging of tumor samples and 
      correlated with (18)F-AH113804 PET imaging results. RESULTS: Baseline uptake of
      (18)F-AH113804, determined in tumor-bearing animals after 10 d, was approximately
      2-fold higher in the tumor than in muscle tissue or the contralateral mammary fat
      pad. The tumor growth rate, determined from CT images, was comparable between the
      animals with recurrent tumors, with detection of tumors of low volume (<10 mm(3))
      only possible by day 20 after tumor resection. (18)F-AH113804 PET detected local 
      tumor recurrence as early as 6 d after surgery in the recurrent tumor-bearing
      animals and exhibited significantly higher (18)F-AH113804 uptake (in comparison
      to mammary fatty tissue), with a target-to-background (muscle) ratio of
      approximately 3:1 (P < 0.01). The c-Met expression of individual resected tumor
      samples, determined by immunofluorescence, correlated with the respective
      (18)F-AH113804 imaging signals (r = 0.82, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: (18)F-AH113804
      PET provides a new diagnostic tool for the detection of c-Met-expressing primary 
      tumor and has potential utility for the detection of locoregional recurrence from
      an early stage.

TI  - The Genomic Grade Assay Compared With Ki67 to Determine Risk of Distant Breast
      Cancer Recurrence.
PG  - 217-24
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.4377 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Genomic Grade Index (GGI) was previously developed, evaluated on 
      frozen tissue, and shown to be prognostic in early breast cancer. To test the GGI
      in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tumors, a quantitative reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was developed and named the Genomic
      Grade (GG). The GG assay has the potential to increase the clinical application
      of the GGI, but robust demonstration of the clinical validity of the GG assay is 
      required. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic ability of the GG assay to detect
      breast cancer recurrence compared with centrally reviewed immunohistochemical
      testing of Ki67 antigen proliferation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is
      an internationally collaborative substudy of a large phase 3 4-arm adjuvant
      trial. Patients had endocrine receptor-positive, node-positive, or node-negative 
      nonmetastatic primary breast cancer. Patients included in this study had
      available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of their primary tumors and
      were randomized to either a 5-year tamoxifen monotherapy arm or a 5-year
      letrozole monotherapy arm. Associations between either GG assay results or
      log2-transformed Ki67 data and survival end points were evaluated using Cox
      regression models stratified for chemotherapy use; the 2 vs 4 arm randomization
      option; and endocrine therapy assignment with and without adjustment for
      clinicopathological parameters, including centrally reviewed histological grade, 
      hormone receptors, and ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu). The likelihood ratio
      statistic was used to assess the added prognostic value. INTERVENTIONS: Central
      evaluation and comparison, blinded for clinical information, of the GG assay,
      breast cancer histological grade, and Ki67. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Distant
      recurrence-free interval (DRFI). RESULTS: Genomic Grade assay data were obtained 
      in 883 breast cancer samples (62%). At a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 84 (10%) 
      had distant recurrences. Increasing GG or Ki67 were both significantly associated
      with lower DRFI and added independent prognostic information to the
      clinicopathological prognostic factors. In patients with early node-negative
      breast cancer who were endocrine-only treated, 38% were GG1 with a 10-year DRFI
      of 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%), and 18% were histological grade 1 with a 10-year DRFI 
      of 100% (95% CI, 100%-100%). For GG equivocal patients, the 10-year DRFI was 94% 
      (95% CI, 90%-98%), and for GG3 patients, the 10-year DRFI was 87% (95% CI,
      80%-94%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Either the GG assay or centrally reviewed
      Ki67 significantly improves clinicopathological models to determine distant
      recurrence of breast cancer. Compared with the histological grade, the GG assay
      can identify a higher proportion of endocrine-only treated patients with very low
      risk of distant recurrence at 10 years. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov

TI  - Postmastectomy radiotherapy benefit in Chinese breast cancer patients with T1-T2 
      tumor and 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes by molecular subtypes: an analysis of
      1369 cases.
PG  - 6465-75
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-4546-0 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the association between molecular subtype
      (MST) and prognosis and research the postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) effect in
      T1-T2 tumors with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). This retrospective
      study studied breast cancer patients with T1-T2 tumors and 1-3 positive ALNs
      according to MST: Luminal A, Luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 
      (Her-2) positive, and Triple negative. The impact of adjuvant PMRT in T1-T2
      tumors with 1-3 positive ALNs was also assessed. This study included 1369
      patients: 33.0 % Luminal A, 42.9 % Luminal B, 11.9 % Her-2 positive, and 12.2 %
      Triple negative. On univariate and multivariate analyses, MST was associated with
      locoregional relapse (LRR). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PMRT significantly 
      decreased LRR risk (p = 0.017) and distant metastasis (DM) risk (p < 0.0001). In 
      subgroup analysis, PMRT showed significant benefits of improvement in LRR in
      patients with younger age, positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and ratio of
      positive lymph nodes (LNs) >25 %. Moreover, the nomogram could more accurately
      predict LRR (c-index 0.75) in T1-2N1 breast cancer patients. MST associated with 
      patient outcomes in breast cancer patients with T1-T2 tumors and 1-3 positive
      ALN. It makes sense to offer PMRT for patients aged<40 years old, LVI, 2 and 3
      positive lymph nodes, and ratio of positive LNs >25 %.

TI  - Mammographic density adds accuracy to both the Tyrer-Cuzick and Gail breast
      cancer risk models in a prospective UK screening cohort.
PG  - 147
LID - 10.1186/s13058-015-0653-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Predicting Risk of Cancer at Screening study in Manchester, UK,
      is a prospective study of breast cancer risk estimation. It was designed to
      assess whether mammographic density may help in refinement of breast cancer risk 
      estimation using either the Gail model (Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool) or
      the Tyrer-Cuzick model (International Breast Intervention Study model). METHODS: 
      Mammographic density was measured at entry as a percentage visual assessment,
      adjusted for age and body mass index. Tyrer-Cuzick and Gail 10-year risks were
      based on a questionnaire completed contemporaneously. Breast cancers were
      identified at the entry screen or shortly thereafter. The contribution of density
      to risk models was assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with profile likelihood
      confidence intervals (CIs) and area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve (AUC). The calibration of predicted ORs was estimated as a percentage
      [(observed vs expected (O/E)] from logistic regression. RESULTS: The analysis
      included 50,628 women aged 47-73 years who were recruited between October 2009
      and September 2013. Of these, 697 had breast cancer diagnosed after enrolment.
      Median follow-up was 3.2 years. Breast density [interquartile range odds ratio
      (IQR-OR) 1.48, 95 % CI 1.34-1.63, AUC 0.59] was a slightly stronger univariate
      risk factor than the Tyrer-Cuzick model [IQR-OR 1.36 (95 % CI 1.25-1.48), O/E 60 
      % (95 % CI 44-74), AUC 0.57] or the Gail model [IQR-OR 1.22 (95 % CI 1.12-1.33), 
      O/E 46 % (95 % CI 26-65 %), AUC 0.55]. It continued to add information after
      allowing for Tyrer-Cuzick [IQR-OR 1.47 (95 % CI 1.33-1.62), combined AUC 0.61] or
      Gail [IQR-OR 1.45 (95 % CI 1.32-1.60), combined AUC 0.59]. CONCLUSIONS: Breast
      density may be usefully combined with the Tyrer-Cuzick model or the Gail model.

AB  - Recently, targeting deregulated energy metabolism is an emerging strategy for
      cancer therapy. In the present study, combination of DCA and metformin markedly
      induced cell death, compared with each drug alone. Furthermore, the expression
      levels of glycolytic enzymes including HK2, LDHA and ENO1 were downregulated by
      two drugs. Interestingly, HIF-1alpha activation markedly suppressed
      DCA/metformin-induced cell death and recovered the expressions of glycolytic
      enzymes that were decreased by two drugs. Based on these findings, we propose
      that targeting HIF-1alpha is necessary for cancer metabolism targeted therapy.

TI  - Vitamin D (25-0H D3) status and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      in stage II/III breast cancer: Data from the NEOZOTAC trial (BOOG 10-01).
PG  - 69-74

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D3 (vitamin D) have been shown to be
      prognostic for disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer. We
      investigated the predictive value of these levels for pathological response after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer taking part in the
      NEOZOTAC phase-III trial. Additionally, the effect of chemotherapy on vitamin D
      levels was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum vitamin D was measured at
      baseline and before the last cycle of chemotherapy. The relationship between
      these measurements and clinical outcome, as defined by pathological complete
      response in breast and lymph nodes (pCR) was examined. RESULTS: Baseline and end 
      of treatment vitamin D data were available in 169 and 91 patients, respectively. 
      Median baseline vitamin D values were 58.0 nmol/L. In patients treated with
      chemotherapy only, serum vitamin D levels decreased during neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (median decrease of 16 nmol/L, P = 0.003). The prevalence of vitamin
      D levels < 50 nmol/L increased from 38.3% at baseline to 55.9% after
      chemotherapy. In the total population, baseline and end of therapy vitamin D
      levels were not related to pathological response. No associations were found
      between pCR and vitamin D level changes. CONCLUSION: The significant decrease in 
      vitamin D post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy suggests that vitamin D levels should be 
      monitored and in case of decrease of vitamin D levels, correction may be
      beneficial for skeletal health and possibly breast cancer outcome.

AB  - As epithelial tumors grow from single cells to a malignant mass of invasive
      tissue, they must exploit the innate inflammatory response, while evading the
      adaptive immune system. Prognosis of solid tumors has historically focused on
      macroscopic features such as size, grade, and mitotic index. It is now clear that
      prognosis assessment must also consider the stromal and immune cells that
      surround and infiltrate the tumor. Tumors promote growth, angiogenesis, and
      tissue remodeling by subverting the normal functions of macrophages and other
      cells of the innate immune system that inhabit their microenvironment.
      Simultaneously, tumor cells escape from and inactivate the adaptive immune system
      by exploiting the mechanisms preventing damaging auto-immune responses in
      cytotoxic T cells. The presence of CD8(+) T cells within epithelial tumors is now
      a well-supported marker of better prognosis in many tumor types. However, this
      benefit is counterbalanced by immune regulatory cell populations that promote
      tumor escape from immune surveillance and metastasis. Therapeutic approaches that
      kill tumor cells selectively by re-activating immune checkpoints are becoming an 
      established therapeutic option, but it is not yet clear how to identify which
      patients will benefit from this treatment modality. Evidence is accumulating that
      identifying the presence of T cell-activating neoantigens, produced by mutated
      proteins in tumors, will play an important role in checkpoint inhibitor
      prognosis. This review provides an overview of the evidence that lymphocytic
      infiltration of tumors has prognostic value in many epithelial tumor types and is
      linked to the success of chemical and immune checkpoint therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the declining incidence of gastric cancer, mortality rate
      remains high due to late presentation. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of
      miRNA as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer in the circulation. METHODS:
      Plasma samples from 3 independent groups comprise 123 gastric cancer patients and
      111 healthy controls for miRNA profiling from microarray screening. RESULTS:
      Microarray data showed that 25 miRNAs were upregulated in gastric cancer patients
      and 6 highly expressed miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-140-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-627, miR-629
      and miR-652) were selected for validation. In an independent validation set,
      levels of miR-627, miR-629 and miR-652 were significantly higher in gastric
      cancer patients than healthy controls (P <0.0001). An algorithm with improved
      sensitivity and specificity as gastric cancer classifier was adopted and
      validated in another random set of 15 plasma samples. Results showed that
      combination of 3 miRNAs obtained the highest area under curve, with a cut-off at 
      0.373, with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 85.5%. CONCLUSION: This
      study revealed a three-miRNA signature as a promising classifier for gastric
      cancer, and greatly enhances the feasibility of circulating miRNAs as
      non-invasive diagnostic marker for this disease.

TI  - Genome-wide DNA methylation analyses in lung adenocarcinomas: Association with
      EGFR, KRAS and TP53 mutation status, gene expression and prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation alterations are early events in tumorigenesis and
      important in the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells. Lung cancer
      patients have in general a poor prognosis, and a deeper insight into the
      epigenetic landscape in lung adenocarcinoma tumors and its prognostic
      implications is needed. RESULTS: We determined whole-genome DNA methylation
      profiles of 164 fresh frozen lung adenocarcinoma samples and 19 samples of
      matched normal lung tissue using the Illumina Infinium 450K array. A large number
      of differentially methylated CpGs in lung adenocarcinoma tissue were identified, 
      and specific methylation profiles were observed in tumors with mutations in the
      EGFR-, KRAS- or TP53 genes and according to the patients' smoking status. The
      methylation levels were correlated with gene expression and both positive and
      negative correlations were seen. Methylation profiles of the tumor samples
      identified subtypes of tumors with distinct prognosis, including one subtype
      enriched for TP53 mutant tumors. A prognostic index based on the methylation
      levels of 33 CpGs was established, and was significantly associated with
      prognosis in the univariate analysis using an independent cohort of lung
      adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. CpGs in the HOX B
      and HOX C gene clusters were represented in the prognostic signature.
      CONCLUSIONS: Methylation differences mirror biologically important features in
      the etiology of lung adenocarcinomas and influence prognosis.

TI  - Adjuvant Lapatinib and Trastuzumab for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: Results From the Randomized Phase III Adjuvant
      Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization Trial.
PG  - 1034-42
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2015.62.1797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lapatinib (L) plus trastuzumab (T) improves outcomes for metastatic
      human epidermal growth factor 2-positive breast cancer and increases the
      pathologic complete response in the neoadjuvant setting, but their role as
      adjuvant therapy remains uncertain. METHODS: In the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or
      Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization trial, patients with centrally confirmed human
      epidermal growth factor 2-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to 
      1 year of adjuvant therapy with T, L, their sequence (T-->L), or their
      combination (L+T). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), with
      850 events required for 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.8 for L+T
      versus T. RESULTS: Between June 2007 and July 2011, 8,381 patients were enrolled.
      In 2011, due to futility to demonstrate noninferiority of L versus T, the L arm
      was closed, and patients free of disease were offered adjuvant T. A protocol
      modification required P </= .025 for the two remaining pairwise comparisons. At a
      protocol-specified analysis with a median follow-up of 4.5 years, a 16% reduction
      in the DFS hazard rate was observed with L+T compared with T (555 DFS events; HR,
      0.84; 97.5% CI, 0.70 to 1.02; P = .048), and a 4% reduction was observed with
      T-->L compared with T (HR, 0.96; 97.5% CI, 0.80 to 1.15; P = .61). L-treated
      patients experienced more diarrhea, cutaneous rash, and hepatic toxicity compared
      with T-treated patients. The incidence of cardiac toxicity was low in all
      treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant treatment that includes L did not
      significantly improve DFS compared with T alone and added toxicity. One year of
      adjuvant T remains standard of care.

TI  - Clinical validity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes analysis in patients with
      triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 249-56
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated
      with a favorable prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, this
      marker is not currently considered robust enough for entering the clinical
      practice. In the present study, we assessed the clinical validity of the
      guidelines recently issued by the International TIL Working Group in a large
      retrospective series of well-annotated TNBC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TILs 
      were evaluated in all the full-face H&E sections from 897 consecutive TNBC (i.e. 
      tumors with <1% of ER and PgR immunoreactivity and absence of HER2 overexpression
      or amplification) patients diagnosed and treated at the European Institute of
      Oncology between 1995 and 2010 (median follow-up 8.2 years, range 6 months to 18 
      years). All mononuclear cells were evaluated in the stromal area within the
      borders of the invasive tumor, reported as a percentage value and treated as a
      continuous variable in survival analysis. RESULTS: The median percentage of TILs 
      was 20%, and 21.9% of the cases had >/=50% (lymphocyte predominant breast cancer,
      LPBC) TILs. At univariable survival analysis, TILs were a significant predictor
      of better disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and
      overall survival (OS) (P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis confirmed that each
      10% increase in TILs strongly predicted better survival, independent of patients'
      age, lymph node status, tumor size, histological grade, peritumoral vascular
      invasion and Ki-67 labeling index. Patients with LPBC had a 10-year survival rate
      of 71%, 84% and 96% for DFS, DDFS and OS, respectively. Stratified analysis
      revealed a positive correlation between TILs and OS across all the subgroups
      analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data support the analytical validity of the recently
      issued TILs evaluation guidelines in the clinical practice.

TI  - ESR1 and ESR2 polymorphisms in the BIG 1-98 trial comparing adjuvant letrozole
      versus tamoxifen or their sequence for early breast cancer.
PG  - 543-55
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3634-6 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and ESR2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with 
      endocrine-mediated physiological mechanisms, and inconsistently with breast
      cancer risk and outcomes, bone mineral density changes, and hot flushes/night
      sweats. DNA was isolated and genotyped for six ESR1 and two ESR2
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from tumor specimens from 3691
      postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer enrolled in the
      BIG 1-98 trial to receive tamoxifen and/or letrozole for 5 years. Associations
      with recurrence and adverse events (AEs) were assessed using Cox proportional
      hazards models. 3401 samples were successfully genotyped for five SNPs. ESR1
      rs9340799(XbaI) (T>C) variants CC or TC were associated with reduced breast
      cancer risk (HR = 0.82,95% CI = 0.67-1.0), and ESR1 rs2077647 (T>C) variants CC
      or TC was associated with reduced distant recurrence risk (HR = 0.69, 95% CI =
      0.53-0.90), both regardless of the treatments. No differential treatment effects 
      (letrozole vs. tamoxifen) were observed for the association of outcome with any
      of the SNPs. Letrozole-treated patients with rs2077647 (T>C) variants CC and TC
      had a reduced risk of bone AE (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.58-0.98, P interaction =
      0.08), whereas patients with rs4986938 (G>A) genotype variants AA and AG had an
      increased risk of bone AE (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.01-1.84, P interaction = 0.07). 
      We observed that (1) rare ESR1 homozygous polymorphisms were associated with
      lower recurrence, and (2) ESR1 and ESR2 SNPs were associated with bone AEs in
      letrozole-treated patients. Genes that are involved in estrogen signaling and
      synthesis have the potential to affect both breast cancer recurrence and side
      effects, suggesting that individual treatment strategies can incorporate not only
      oncogenic drivers but also SNPs related to estrogen activity.

LID - 10.1002/jmri.25090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of
      diffusion kurtosis magnetic resonance imaging parameters for differentiating
      high-grade gliomas (HGGs) from primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs).
      METHODS: Diffusion parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean
      diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda// ), radial diffusivity (lambda
      perpendicular ); and kurtosis parameters, including mean kurtosis (MK), axial
      kurtosis (K// ), and radial kurtosis (K perpendicular ), were normalized to
      contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWMc) to decrease inter-individual 
      and inter-regional changes across the entire brain, and then compared with the
      solid parts of 20 HGGs and 11 PCNSLs [median 95% confidence interval (CI), P <
      0.004; 0.05/14], significance level, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Bonferroni
      correction]. RESULTS: FA, MD, lambda// , and lambda perpendicular values were
      higher in HGGs than in PCNSLs, but not significantly [HGGs: 0.209 (95% CI,
      0.134-0.338), 1.385 (95% CI, 1.05-1.710), 1.655 (95% CI, 1.30-2.060), 1.228 (95% 
      CI, 0.932-1.480), respectively; PCNSLs: 0.143 (95% CI, 0.110-0.317), 1.070 (95%
      CI, 0.842-1.470), 1.260 (95% CI, 0.960-1.930), 1.010 (95% CI, 0.782-1.240)],
      respectively; P = 0.120, 0.010, 0.004, and 0.004, respectively). However, MK and 
      K// were significantly higher in PCNSLs compared with HGGs [PCNSLs: 0.765 (95%
      CI, 0.697-0.890), 0.787 (95% CI, 0.615-1.030), respectively; HGGs: 0.531 (95% CI,
      0.402-0.766), 0.532 (95% CI, 0.432-0.680], respectively; P = 0.001, 0.000,
      respectively); but not K perpendicular [0.774 (95% CI, 0.681-0.899) for PCNSLs;
      0.554 (95% CI, 0.389-0.954) for HGGs; P = 0.024]. CONCLUSION: There were
      significant differences in kurtosis parameters (MK and K// ) between HGGs and
      PCNSLs, while differences in diffusion parameters between them did not reach
      significance; hence, better separation was achieved with these parameters than
      with conventional diffusion imaging parameters. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

TI  - Gene expression alterations associated with outcome in aromatase
      inhibitor-treated ER+ early-stage breast cancer patients.
PG  - 483-94
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3644-4 [doi]
AB  - Aromatase inhibitors (AI), either alone or together with chemotherapy, have
      become the standard adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal, estrogen
      receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Although AIs improve overall survival,
      resistance is still a major clinical problem, thus additional biomarkers
      predictive of outcome of ER+ breast cancer patients treated with AIs are needed. 
      Global gene expression analysis was performed on ER+ primary breast cancers from 
      patients treated with adjuvant AI monotherapy; half experienced recurrence
      (median follow-up 6.7 years). Gene expression alterations were validated by
      qRT-PCR, and functional studies evaluating the effect of siRNA-mediated gene
      knockdown on cell growth were performed. Twenty-six genes, including TFF3, DACH1,
      RGS5, and GHR, were shown to exhibit altered expression in tumors from patients
      with recurrence versus non-recurrent (fold change >/=1.5, p < 0.05), and the gene
      expression alterations were confirmed using qRT-PCR. Ten of these 26 genes could 
      be linked in a network associated with cellular proliferation, growth, and
      development. TFF3, which encodes for trefoil factor 3 and is an
      estrogen-responsive oncogene shown to play a functional role in tamoxifen
      resistance and metastasis of ER+ breast cancer, was also shown to be upregulated 
      in an AI-resistant cell line model, and reduction of TFF3 levels using
      TFF3-specific siRNAs decreased the growth of both the AI-resistant and -sensitive
      parental cell lines. Moreover, overexpression of TFF3 in parental AI-sensitive
      MCF-7/S0.5 cells resulted in reduced sensitivity to the AI exemestane, whereas
      TFF3 overexpression had no effect on growth in the absence of exemestane,
      indicating that TFF3 mediates growth and survival signals that abrogate the
      growth inhibitory effect of exemestane. We identified a panel of 26 genes
      exhibiting altered expression associated with disease recurrence in patients
      treated with adjuvant AI monotherapy, including TFF3, which was shown to exhibit 
      a growth- and survival-promoting effect in the context of AI treatment.

TI  - The benefit of HER2-targeted therapies on overall survival of patients with
      metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer--a systematic review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at evaluating the overall survival (OS) gain
      associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed
      therapies in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC). METHODS: A
      bibliographic search was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane databases. Only phase
      III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including HER2-positive (HER2+) mBC
      patients were included in this review. OS was defined as time from randomization 
      until the occurrence of death from any cause. Studies have been grouped according
      to the line of treatment, i.e., first-line or second-line or beyond. RESULTS:
      Nineteen RCTs were eligible for inclusion, of which 12 assessed therapies
      targeting HER2+ mBC in the first-line setting. OS improved from 20.3 months in
      the first RCT (standard chemotherapy; Slamon et al. (N Engl J Med 344:783-92,
      2001)) evaluating HER2-targeting therapies to 48 months in the study of Swain et 
      al. (Lancet Oncol 14:461-71, 2013), with triple combination of pertuzumab,
      trastuzumab and docetaxel. Seven RCTs evaluated the OS of HER2-targeting
      therapies in the second-line setting and beyond. The OS in second-line setting
      improved from 15.3 months (capecitabine; Cameron et al. (Breast Cancer Res Treat 
      112:533-43, 2008)) to 30.7 months (trastuzumab emtansine; Verma et al. (N Engl J 
      Med 367:1783-91, 2012)). In the third-line setting, the association of lapatinib 
      and trastuzumab has demonstrated to improve OS to 4.5 months compared with
      lapatinib alone (14 months vs. 9.5 months; Blackwell et al. (J Clin Oncol
      30:2585-92, 2012)). CONCLUSIONS: HER2-directed therapies had an undeniable
      beneficial impact on the OS of patients with HER2+ mBC. The triple combination of
      docetaxel, pertuzumab and trastuzumab is associated with a survival extent of
      more than 4.5 years, compared with a life expectancy of 1.5 years achieved 14
      years ago.

TI  - MiR-106b~25 cluster regulates multidrug resistance in an ABC
      transporter-independent manner via downregulation of EP300.
PG  - 1170-8
LID - 10.3892/or.2015.4412 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA (miR)-106b~25 cluster regulates bypass of doxorubicin and
      gamma-radiation induced senescence by downregulation of the E-cadherin
      transcriptional activator EP300. We asked whether upregulation of miR-106~25
      cluster generates cells with a truly multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype and
      whether this is due to upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
      P-glycoprotein. We used minimally transformed mammary epithelial breast cancer
      cells (MTMECs) in which the miR-106b~25 cluster was experimentally upregulated by
      lentiviral transfection or in which hairpins targeting either EP300 or E-cadherin
      mRNAs have been expressed with lentiviruses. We find that overexpression of
      miR-106b~25 cluster led to the generation of MDR MTMECs (resistant to etoposide, 
      colchicine and paclitaxel). Paclitaxel resistance was also studied after
      experimental downregulation of EP300 or E-cadherin. However none of these cells
      overexpressed P-glycoprotein or where able to efflux a fluorescent derivative of 
      paclitaxel, making this phenotype drug-transporter independent. Paclitaxel
      treatment in MTMECs led to an increase in early apoptotic cells (Annexin
      V-positive), activation of caspase-9 and increase in the proportion of cells at
      the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. However, MTMEC overexpressing miR-106b~25
      cluster, or with EP300 or E-cadherin downregulated, showed less activation of
      apoptosis, caspase-9 and caspase-3/-7 activities. Thus, miR-106b~25 cluster
      controls transporter-independent MDR by apoptosis evasion via downregulation of
      EP300.

TI  - Lapatinib Plasma and Tumor Concentrations and Effects on HER Receptor
      Phosphorylation in Tumor.
PG  - e0142845
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0142845 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The paradigm shift in cancer treatment from cytotoxic drugs to tumor
      targeted therapies poses new challenges, including optimization of dose and
      schedule based on a biologically effective dose, rather than the historical
      maximum tolerated dose. Optimal dosing is currently determined using
      concentrations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in plasma as a surrogate for tumor
      concentrations. To examine this plasma-tumor relationship, we explored the
      association between lapatinib levels in tumor and plasma in mice and humans, and 
      those effects on phosphorylation of human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER)
      in human tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mice bearing BT474 HER2+ human breast
      cancer xenografts were dosed once or twice daily (BID) with lapatinib. Drug
      concentrations were measured in blood, tumor, liver, and kidney. In a randomized 
      phase I clinical trial, 28 treatment-naive female patients with early stage HER2+
      breast cancer received lapatinib 1000 or 1500 mg once daily (QD) or 500 mg BID
      before evaluating steady-state lapatinib levels in plasma and tumor. RESULTS: In 
      mice, lapatinib levels were 4-fold higher in tumor than blood with a 4-fold
      longer half-life. Tumor concentrations exceeded the in vitro IC90 (~ 900 nM or
      500 ng/mL) for inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation throughout the 12-hour dosing
      interval. In patients, tumor levels were 6- and 10-fold higher with QD and BID
      dosing, respectively, compared to plasma trough levels. The relationship between 
      tumor and plasma concentration was complex, indicating multiple determinants. HER
      receptor phosphorylation varied depending upon lapatinib tumor concentrations,
      suggestive of changes in the repertoire of HER homo- and heterodimers.
      CONCLUSION: Plasma lapatinib concentrations underestimated tumor drug levels,
      suggesting that optimal dosing should be focused on the site of action to avoid
      to inappropriate dose escalation. Larger clinical trials are required to
      determine optimal dose and schedule to achieve tumor concentrations that
      maximally inhibit HER receptors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      NCT00359190.

TI  - Prognostic Role of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Node-Negative (N0), Triple-Negative
      (TN), Medullary Breast Cancer (MBC) in the Korean Population.
PG  - e0140208
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0140208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the favorable prognosis for medullary breast cancer (MBC),
      the guidelines for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for MBC have not been clearly
      established. This study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant chemotherapy
      in Korean patients with node-negative (N0), triple-negative (TN) MBC patients.
      METHODS: We included data from 252 patients with N0 TN MBC, obtained from the
      Korean Breast Cancer Registry database. Patients were categorized as those who
      did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy (group I) or those who did (group II).
      Clinicopathological characteristics, breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), and 
      overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups. In addition, a subgroup
      analysis for survival based on tumor size was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 252 
      N0 TN MBC patients with tumor sizes >1 cm who were diagnosed between April 1997
      and March 2011 were enrolled. The median age was 44.95 years (range, 25-72
      years), and the median follow-up period was 93.94 months (range, 23-195 months). 
      Overall, the BCSS and OS in group II (97.3% and 97.3%, respectively) were
      significantly better compared with those in group I (89.2% and 86.2%,
      respectively). In the subgroup analysis, in patients with tumors >2 cm in size,
      those in group II had significant better BCSS and OS (97.5% and 97.5%,
      respectively) compared with those in group I (78.3% and 73.9%, respectively). In 
      contrast in those with tumors 1-2 cm in size, there were no significant
      differences in BCSS and OS between the groups (both 97.1% for group I, and 95.2% 
      and 92.9%, respectively for group II). Multivariate analysis revealed that
      adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved BCSS (P = 0.009) and OS (P = 0.007),
      but only for patients with larger tumors (>2 cm). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with
      N0 TN MBC, adjuvant chemotherapy had a significant clinical survival benefit, but
      only in those with tumors >2 cm.

PG  - 16467
LID - 10.1038/srep16467 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) help to understand the effects of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on breast cancer (BC) progression and survival.
      We performed multiple analyses on data from a previously conducted GWAS for the
      influence of individual SNPs, runs of homozygosity (ROHs) and inbreeding on BC
      survival. (I.) The association of individual SNPs indicated no differences in the
      proportions of homozygous individuals among short-time survivors (STSs) and
      long-time survivors (LTSs). (II.) The analysis revealed differences among the
      populations for the number of ROHs per person and the total and average length of
      ROHs per person and among LTSs and STSs for the number of ROHs per person. (III.)
      Common ROHs at particular genomic positions were nominally more frequent among
      LTSs than in STSs. Common ROHs showed significant evidence for natural selection 
      (iHS, Tajima's D, Fay-Wu's H). Most regions could be linked to genes related to
      BC progression or treatment. (IV.) Results were supported by a higher level of
      inbreeding among LTSs. Our results showed that an increased level of homozygosity
      may result in a preference of individuals during BC treatment. Although common
      ROHs were short, variants within ROHs might favor survival of BC and may function
      in a recessive manner.

TI  - Aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal syndrome: a significant problem with 
      limited treatment options.
PG  - 2139-2146
LID - 10.1007/s00520-015-3001-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal syndrome is experienced
      by approximately half of women taking aromatase inhibitors, impairing quality of 
      life and leading some to discontinue treatment. Evidence for effective treatments
      is lacking. We aimed to understand the manifestations and impact of this syndrome
      in the Australian breast cancer community, and strategies used for its
      management. METHODS: A survey invitation was sent to 2390 members of the Breast
      Cancer Network Australia Review and Survey Group in April 2014. The online
      questionnaire included 45 questions covering demographics, aromatase inhibitor
      use, clinical manifestations and risk factors for the aromatase inhibitor
      musculoskeletal syndrome, reasons for treatment discontinuation and efficacy of
      interventions used. RESULTS: Aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal syndrome
      was reported by 302 (82 %) of 370 respondents. Twenty-seven percent had
      discontinued treatment for any reason and of these, 68 % discontinued because of 
      the musculoskeletal syndrome. Eighty-one percent had used at least one
      intervention from the following three categories to manage the syndrome: doctor
      prescribed medications, over-the-counter/complementary medicines or
      alternative/non-drug therapies. Anti-inflammatories, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 
      and yoga were most successful in relieving symptoms in each of the respective
      categories. Almost a third of respondents reported that one or more interventions
      helped prevent aromatase inhibitor discontinuation. However, approximately 20 %
      of respondents found no intervention effective in any category. CONCLUSION: We
      conclude that aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal syndrome is a
      significant issue for Australian women and is an important reason for treatment
      discontinuation. Women use a variety of interventions to manage this syndrome;
      however, their efficacy appears limited.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a systematic
      review, meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis.
PG  - 890
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1904-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To summarize data on long-term ipsilateral local recurrence (LR) and 
      breast cancer death rate (BCDR) for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      who received different treatments. METHODS: Systematic review and study-level
      meta-analysis of prospective (n = 5) and retrospective (n = 21) studies of
      patients with pure DCIS and with median or mean follow-up time of >/=10 years.
      Meta-regression was performed to assess and adjust for effects of potential
      confounders - the average age of women, period of initial treatment, and of bias 
      - follow-up duration on recurrence- and death-rates in each treatment group. LR
      and BCDR rates by local treatment used were reported. Outside of randomized
      trials, remaining studies were likely to have tailored patient treatment
      according to the clinical situation. RESULTS: Nine thousand four hundred and four
      DCIS cases in 9391 patients with 10-year follow-up were included. The adjusted
      meta-regression LR rate for mastectomy was 2.6 % (95 % CI, 0.8-4.5);
      breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy (RT), 13.6 % (95 % CI, 9.8-17.4);
      breast-conserving surgery without RT, 25.5 % (95 % CI, 18.1-32.9); and
      biopsy-only (residual predominately low-grade DCIS following inadequate
      excision), 27.8 % (95 % CI, 8.4-47.1). RT + tamoxifen (TAM) in conservation
      surgery (CS) patients resulted in lower LR compared to one or no adjuvant
      treatments: LR rate for CS + RT + TAM, 9.7 %; CS + RT(no TAM), 14.1 %; CS +
      TAM(no RT), 24.7 %; CS(alone), 25.1 % (linear trend for treatment P < 0.0001).
      Compared to CS + RT + TAM, a significantly higher invasive LR was observed for
      CS(alone), odds ratio (OR) 2.61 (P < 0.0001); CS + TAM(no RT), OR 2.52 (P =
      0.001); CS + RT(no TAM), OR 1.59 (P = 0.022). BCDR was similar for mastectomy,
      breast-conserving surgery with or without RT (1.3-2.0 %) and non-significantly
      higher for biopsy-only (2.7 %). Additionally, the 15-year follow-up was reported 
      where all like-studies had >/= 15-year data sets; the biopsy-only patients had a 
      meta-analysed total LR rate of 40.2 % and the invasive LR rate was 28.1 %. The
      biopsy-only patients had a >/= 15-year BCDR (that included women with metastatic 
      disease) of 17.9 %; the >/= 15-year BCDR was 55.2 % for those with invasive LR.
      CONCLUSIONS: More local intervention was associated with greater local control
      for patients with DCIS at long-term follow-up. For patients undergoing
      breast-conservation, invasive LR was significantly lower when two rather than one
      adjuvant treatment modalities were given.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate whether Stage
      IIIC (TanyN3M0) breast cancer can be classified further into subgroups with
      different prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two patients
      with Stage IIIC breast cancer at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and 
      Hospital were analyzed. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
      were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method for lymph node ratio (LNR) and the number 
      of positive lymph node (PLN). The receiver operating characteristic curve
      analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off value of the LNR and PLN.
      The univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to identify the prognostic 
      factors. RESULTS: The results showed that the optimal cut-off value of LNR value 
      was 0.65, and the optimal cut-off value of PLN was 15. The Kaplan-Meier survival 
      analysis showed the higher value of LNR or PLN was correlated with shortened DFS 
      (P = 0.002, P = 0.008, respectively) and OS (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively).
      In multivariate survival analysis, the value of LNR and PLN were still remained
      as independent prognostic factors for DFS (P = 0.014, P = 0.013, respectively)
      and OS (P = 0.004, P = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results suggest
      that the value of LNR or PLN could be used as a new significant prognostic
      biomarker for Stage IIIC breast cancer patients. Stage IIIC breast cancer
      patients with lower value of LNR or PLN may be down staged.

AB  - Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) characterized by the presence of
      dysplasia and DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs), may reflect chromosomal
      instability (CIN) and predispose to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Early
      detection of OPMDs with such characteristics may play a crucial role in OSCC
      prevention. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between CNAs,
      histological diagnosis, oral subsite and aneuploidy in OPMDs/OSCCs. Samples from 
      OPMDs and OSCCs were processed by high-resolution DNA flow cytometry (hr DNA-FCM)
      to determine the relative nuclear DNA content. Additionally, CNAs were obtained
      for a subset of these samples by genome-wide array comparative genomic
      hybridization (aCGH) using DNA extracted from either diploid or aneuploid nuclei 
      suspension sorted by FCM. Our study shows that: i) aneuploidy, global genomic
      imbalance (measured as the total number of CNAs) and specific focal CNAs occur
      early in the development of oral cancer and become more frequent at later stages;
      ii) OPMDs limited to tongue (TNG) mucosa display a higher frequency of aneuploidy
      compared to OPMDs confined to buccal mucosa (BM) as measured by DNA-FCM; iii) TNG
      OPMDs/OSCCs show peculiar features of CIN compared to BM OPMDs/OSCCs given the
      preferential association with total broad and specific focal CNA gains. Follow-up
      studies are warranted to establish whether the presence of DNA aneuploidy and
      specific focal or broad CNAs may predict cancer development in non-dysplastic
      OPMDs.

TI  - Cardiac Outcomes of Patients Receiving Adjuvant Weekly Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab
      for Node-Negative, ERBB2-Positive Breast Cancer.
PG  - 29-36
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.3709 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Trastuzumab is a life-saving therapy but is associated with
      symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline.
      We report the cardiac toxic effects of a nonanthracycline and trastuzumab-based
      treatment for patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
      (ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)-positive breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the cardiac safety of paclitaxel with trastuzumab and the utility of
      LVEF monitoring in patients with node-negative, ERBB2-positive breast cancer.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this secondary analysis of an uncontrolled,
      single group study across 14 medical centers, enrollment of 406 patients with
      node-negative, ERBB2-positive breast cancer 3 cm, or smaller, and baseline LVEF
      of greater than or equal to 50% occurred from October 9, 2007, to September 3,
      2010. Patients with a micrometastasis in a lymph node were later allowed with a
      study amendment. Median patient age was 55 years, 118 (29%) had hypertension, and
      30 (7%) had diabetes. Patients received adjuvant paclitaxel for 12 weeks with
      trastuzumab, and trastuzumab was continued for 1 year. Median follow-up was 4
      years. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment consisted of weekly 80-mg/m2 doses of paclitaxel 
      administered concurrently with trastuzumab intravenously for 12 weeks, followed
      by trastuzumab monotherapy for 39 weeks. During the monotherapy phase,
      trastuzumab could be administered weekly 2-mg/kg or every 3 weeks as 6-mg/kg.
      Radiation and hormone therapy were administered per standard guidelines after
      completion of the 12 weeks of chemotherapy. Patient LVEF was assessed at
      baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cardiac
      safety data, including grade 3 to 4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) 
      and significant asymptomatic LVEF decline, as defined by our study, were
      reported. RESULTS: Overall, 2 patients (0.5%) (95% CI, 0.1%-1.8%) developed grade
      3 LVSD and came off study, and 13 (3.2%) (95% CI, 1.9%-5.4%) had significant
      asymptomatic LVEF decline, 11 of whom completed study treatment. Median LVEF at
      baseline was 65%; 12 weeks, 64%; 6 months, 64%; and 1 year, 64%. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Cardiac toxic effects from paclitaxel with trastuzumab, manifesting as
      grade 3 or 4 LVSD or asymptomatic LVEF decline, were low. Patient LVEF was
      assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year, and our findings suggest
      that LVEF monitoring during trastuzumab therapy without anthracyclines could be
      simplified for many individuals.

AB  - Cancer cells grow in highly complex stromal microenvironments, which through
      metabolic remodelling, catabolism, autophagy and inflammation nurture them and
      are able to facilitate metastasis and resistance to therapy. However, these
      changes in the metabolic profile of stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts and
      their impact on cancer initiation, progression and metastasis are not well-known.
      This is the first study to provide a comprehensive proteomic portrait of the
      azathioprine and taxol-induced catabolic state on human stromal fibroblasts,
      which comprises changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes, myofibroblastic
      differentiation markers, antioxidants, proteins involved in autophagy,
      senescence, vesicle trafficking and protein degradation, and inducers of
      inflammation. Interestingly, many of these features are major contributors to the
      aging process. A catabolic stroma signature, generated with proteins found
      differentially up-regulated in taxol-treated fibroblasts, strikingly correlates
      with recurrence, metastasis and poor patient survival in several solid
      malignancies. We therefore suggest the inhibition of the catabolic state in
      healthy cells as a novel approach to improve current chemotherapy efficacies and 
      possibly avoid future carcinogenic processes.

TI  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and extrapleural pneumonectomy of malignant pleural

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative hemithoracic radiotherapy has been used to treat
      malignant pleural mesothelioma, but it has not been assessed in a randomised
      trial. We assessed high-dose hemithoracic radiotherapy after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and extrapleural pneumonectomy in patients with malignant pleural
      mesothelioma. METHODS: We did this phase 2 trial in two parts at 14 hospitals in 
      Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany. We enrolled patients with pathologically
      confirmed malignant pleural mesothelioma; resectable TNM stages T1-3 N0-2, M0;
      WHO performance status 0-1; age 18-70 years. In part 1, patients were given three
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500
      mg/m(2) on day 1 given every 3 weeks) and extrapleural pneumonectomy; the primary
      endpoint was complete macroscopic resection (R0-1). In part 2, participants with 
      complete macroscopic resection were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive high-dose 
      radiotherapy or not. The target volume for radiotherapy encompassed the entire
      hemithorax, the thoracotomy channel, and mediastinal nodal stations if affected
      by the disease or violated surgically. A boost was given to areas at high risk
      for locoregional relapse. The allocation was stratified by centre, histology
      (sarcomatoid vs epithelioid or mixed), mediastinal lymph node involvement (N0-1
      vs N2), and T stage (T1-2 vs T3). The primary endpoint of part 1 was the
      proportion of patients achieving complete macroscopic resection (R0 and R1). The 
      primary endpoint in part 2 was locoregional relapse-free survival, analysed by
      intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
      NCT00334594. FINDINGS: We enrolled patients between Dec 7, 2005, and Oct 17,
      2012. Overall, we analysed 151 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, of
      whom 113 (75%) had extrapleural pneumonectomy. Median follow-up was 54.2 months
      (IQR 32-66). 52 (34%) of 151 patients achieved an objective response. The most
      common grade 3 or 4 toxic effects were neutropenia (21 [14%] of 151 patients),
      anaemia (11 [7%]), and nausea or vomiting (eight [5%]). 113 patients had
      extrapleural pneumonectomy, with complete macroscopic resection achieved in 96
      (64%) of 151 patients. We enrolled 54 patients in part 2; 27 in each group. The
      main reasons for exclusion were patient refusal (n=20) and ineligibility (n=10). 
      25 of 27 patients completed radiotherapy. Median total radiotherapy dose was 55.9
      Gy (IQR 46.8-56.0). Median locoregional relapse-free survival from surgery, was
      7.6 months (95% CI 4.5-10.7) in the no radiotherapy group and 9.4 months
      (6.5-11.9) in the radiotherapy group. The most common grade 3 or higher toxic
      effects related to radiotherapy were nausea or vomiting (three [11%] of 27
      patients), oesophagitis (two [7%]), and pneumonitis (two [7%]). One patient died 
      of pneumonitis. We recorded no toxic effects data for the control group.
      INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not support the routine use of hemithoracic
      radiotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      and extrapleural pneumonectomy. FUNDING: Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype
      with the worst prognosis and no targeted treatments. TNBC patients are more
      likely to develop metastases and relapse than patients with other breast cancer
      subtypes. We aimed to identify TNBC-specific genes and genes associated with
      lymph node metastasis, one of the first signs of metastatic spread. A total of 33
      TNBCs were used; 17 of which had matched normal adjacent tissues available, and
      15 with matched lymph node metastases. Gene expression microarray analysis was
      used to reveal genes that were differentially expressed between these groups. We 
      identified and validated 66 genes that are significantly altered when comparing
      tumours to normal adjacent samples. Further, we identified 83 genes that are
      associated with lymph node metastasis and correlated these with miRNA-expression.
      Pathway analysis revealed their involvement in DNA repair, recombination and cell
      death, chromosomal instability and other known cancer-related pathways. Finally, 
      four genes were identified that were specific for TNBC, of which one was
      associated with overall survival. This study has identified novel genes involved 
      in LN metastases in TNBC and genes that are TNBC specific that may be used as
      treatment targets or prognostic indicators in the future.

TI  - SOLTI NeoPARP: a phase II randomized study of two schedules of iniparib plus
      paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with
      triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 351-7
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3616-8 [doi]
AB  - Iniparib is an investigational agent with antitumor activity of controversial
      mechanism of action. Two previous trials in advanced triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin showed some
      evidence of efficacy that was not confirmed. This phase II randomized neoadjuvant
      study was designed to explore its activity and tolerability with weekly
      paclitaxel (PTX) as neoadjuvant treatment in TNBC patients. 141 patients with
      Stage II-IIIA TNBC were randomly assigned to receive PTX (80 mg/m(2), d1; n = 47)
      alone or in combination with iniparib, either once-weekly (PWI) (11.2 mg/kg, d1; 
      n = 46) or twice-weekly (PTI) (5.6 mg/kg, d1, 4; n = 48) for 12 weeks. Primary
      endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast. pCR rate was
      similar among the three arms (21, 22, and 19 % for PTX, PWI, and PTI,
      respectively). Secondary efficacy endpoints were comparable: pCR in breast and
      axilla (21, 17, and 19 %); best overall response in the breast (60, 61, and 63
      %); and breast conservation rate (53, 54, and 50 %). Slightly more patients in
      the PTI arm presented grade 3/4 neutropenia (4, 0, and 10 %). Grade 1/2 (28, 22, 
      and 29 %), but no grade 3/4 neuropathy, was observed. There were no differences
      in serious adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events leading to
      treatment discontinuation among the three arms. Addition of iniparib to weekly
      PTX did not add relevant antitumor activity or toxicity. These results do not
      support further evaluation of the combination of iniparib at these doses plus
      paclitaxel in early TNBC.

TI  - Characterization of human breast cancer tissues by infrared imaging.
PG  - 606-19
LID - 10.1039/c5an01512j [doi]
AB  - Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled to microscopy (IR imaging)
      has shown unique advantages in detecting morphological and molecular pathologic
      alterations in biological tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      potential of IR imaging as a diagnostic tool to identify characteristics of
      breast epithelial cells and the stroma. In this study a total of 19 breast tissue
      samples were obtained from 13 patients. For 6 of the patients, we also obtained
      Non-Adjacent Non-Tumor tissue samples. Infrared images were recorded on the main 
      cell/tissue types identified in all breast tissue samples. Unsupervised Principal
      Component Analyses and supervised Partial Least Square Discriminant Analyses
      (PLS-DA) were used to discriminate spectra. Leave-one-out cross-validation was
      used to evaluate the performance of PLS-DA models. Our results show that IR
      imaging coupled with PLS-DA can efficiently identify the main cell types present 
      in FFPE breast tissue sections, i.e. epithelial cells, lymphocytes, connective
      tissue, vascular tissue and erythrocytes. A second PLS-DA model could distinguish
      normal and tumor breast epithelial cells in the breast tissue sections. A
      patient-specific model reached particularly high sensitivity, specificity and MCC
      rates. Finally, we showed that the stroma located close or at distance from the
      tumor exhibits distinct spectral characteristics. In conclusion FTIR imaging
      combined with computational algorithms could be an accurate, rapid and objective 
      tool to identify/quantify breast epithelial cells and differentiate tumor from
      normal breast tissue as well as normal from tumor-associated stroma, paving the
      way to the establishment of a potential complementary tool to ensure safe tumor
      margins.

TI  - Mammographic and clinical characteristics of different phenotypes of
      screen-detected and interval breast cancers in a nationwide screening program.
PG  - 403-15
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3623-9 [doi]
AB  - In the context of a population-based screening program, we aimed to evaluate the 
      major mammographic features and clinicopathological characteristics of breast
      tumors at diagnosis and the associations between them, focusing on tumors with
      the worst prognosis. We analyzed cancers diagnosed in a cohort of 645,764 women
      aged 45-69 years participating in seven population-based screening programs in
      Spain, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2006 and followed up until June
      2009. We included all interval cancers and a sample of screen-detected cancers,
      whether invasive or in situ. We compared tumor-related information and breast
      density for different phenotypes (Triple-negative (TN), HER2+, Luminal B and
      Luminal A) in screen-detected and interval cancers. We used Chi-square or
      Fisher's exact test to compare major mammographic features of invasive versus in 
      situ tumors, of screen-detected versus interval cancers, and of different types
      of interval cancers. We included 2582 tumors (1570 screen-detected and 1012
      interval cancers). There were significant differences in the distribution of most
      clinicopathological variables between screen-detected and interval cancers.
      Invasive TN interval tumors were more common than other phenotypes in breasts
      with low mammographic density; three-quarters of these tumors presented as masses
      without associated calcifications. HER2+ tumors were more common in denser
      breasts and were associated with calcifications and multifocality. Architectural 
      distortion was more common in Luminal A and Luminal B tumors. Certain radiologic 
      findings are associated with pre-invasive lesions; these differ among invasive
      tumor phenotypes. We corroborate that TN and HER2+ cancers have distinctive
      appearances also in the context of population-based screening programs. This
      information can be useful for establishing protocols for diagnostic strategies in
      screening units.

AB  - Cervical cancer (CC) is the third most diagnosed cancer among females worldwide
      and the fourth cause of cancer-related mortality. Prophylactic HPV vaccines and
      traditional pap-smear screening are undoubtedly capable of decreasing the
      incidence and mortality of CC. However, a large number of females succumb to the 
      disease each year due to late diagnosis and resistance to conventional
      treatments. Thus, it is necessary to identify new molecular markers to predict
      the clinical outcome and to design powerful treatments. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
      small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are involved in the
      modulation of several cell pathways associated with progression from
      pre-malignant to invasive and metastatic disease, increasing tumor malignancy.
      The aim of this review was to summarize the recent data that describe the
      important role of miRNAS involved in CC in order to determine their potential as 
      prognostic biomarkers and as therapy targets. Studies of >40 miRNAs with roles in
      cancer regulation were identified. We also identified 17 miRNAs associated with
      progression, 12 involved with clinical outcome and 7 that improved CC treatment
      response. The present review is expected to broaden understanding of the
      functional role and potential clinical uses of miRNAs in CC.

AB  - Recent technological advances have enabled the detection and detailed
      characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA
      (ctDNA) in blood samples from patients with cancer. Often referred to as a
      "liquid biopsy," CTCs and ctDNA are expected to provide real-time monitoring of
      tumor evolution and therapeutic efficacy, with the potential for improved cancer 
      diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we focus on these opportunities as well 
      as the challenges that should be addressed so that these tools may eventually be 
      implemented into routine clinical care.

AB  - Desmedt and colleagues published two articles, one in the June 1, 2007 issue, and
      the other in the August 15, 2008, issue of Clinical Cancer Research, that showed 
      gene-expression signatures to be proliferation driven and time dependent, with
      their prognostic power decreasing with increasing follow-up years. Moreover, the 
      articles showed that immune response is a crucial determinant of prognosis in the
      HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-negative/HER2-negative subtypes, providing a 
      rationale to further explore the role of the antitumor immune response in these
      breast cancer subtypes.

TI  - Factors associated with psychological distress in women with breast
      cancer-related lymphoedema.
PG  - 865-72
LID - 10.1002/pon.4021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that lymphoedema impacts negatively on an
      individual, including psychological distress and body image disturbance,
      particularly for younger women. This study identified psychological factors
      associated with distress in women with breast cancer-related lymphoedema and
      determined whether age moderated the specific relationship between body image
      disturbance and distress. METHODS: Australian women (n = 166) diagnosed with
      breast cancer-related lymphoedema were recruited through a community-based breast
      cancer organisation and lymphoedema treatment clinics. Participants completed an 
      online survey assessing lymphoedema-related cognitions (personal control,
      perceived treatment effectiveness, and consequences of lymphoedema), perceived
      ability to self-regulate lymphoedema-related negative affect, body image
      disturbance, psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), and
      demographic/medical information. RESULTS: Beliefs about the consequences,
      perceived effectiveness of treatment and controllability of lymphoedema,
      perceived ability to self-regulate negative affect, body image disturbance, and
      number of lymphoedema symptoms were correlated with depression, anxiety, and
      stress scores. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that body image
      disturbance was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress,
      and perceived treatment effectiveness was associated with stress. Age was a
      significant moderator of the relationship between body image disturbance and
      depression and anxiety, with older women with greater body image disturbance more
      distressed. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals need to be aware that women
      diagnosed with lymphoedema are at risk of experiencing psychological distress,
      particularly arising from body image disturbance and beliefs that treatment
      cannot control lymphoedema. Furthermore, older women may be at an increased risk 
      of anxiety and depression arising from body image disturbance. Copyright (c) 2015

TI  - Digital versus screen-film mammography: impact of mammographic density and
      hormone therapy on breast cancer detection.
PG  - 377-87
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3622-x [doi]
AB  - Most studies that have examined the effects of mammographic density and hormone
      therapy use on breast cancer detection have included screen-film mammography.
      This study further examines this association in post-menopausal women screened by
      digital mammography. Approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board,
      this study identified 688,418 women of age 50-74 years screened with digital or
      screen-film mammography from 2008 to 2009 within the Ontario Breast Screening
      Program. Of 2993 eligible women with invasive breast cancer, 2450 were contacted 
      and 1421 participated (847 screen-film mammography, 574 digital direct
      radiography). Mammographic density was measured by study radiologists using the
      standard BI-RADS classification system and by a computer-assisted method.
      Information on hormone therapy use was collected by a telephone-administered
      questionnaire. Logistic regression and two-tailed tests for significance
      evaluated associations between factors and detection method by mammography type. 
      Women with >75 % radiologist-measured mammographic density compared to those with
      <25 % were more likely to be diagnosed with an interval than screen-detected
      cancer, with the difference being greater for those screened with screen-film (OR
      = 6.40, 95 % CI 2.30-17.85) than digital mammography (OR = 2.41, 95 % CI
      0.67-8.58) and aged 50-64 years screened with screen-film mammography (OR =
      10.86, 95 % CI 2.96-39.57). Recent former hormone therapy users were also at an
      increased risk of having an interval cancer with the association being
      significant for women screened with digital mammography (OR = 2.08, 95 % CI
      1.17-3.71). Breast screening using digital mammography lowers the risk of having 
      an interval cancer for post-menopausal women aged 50-64 with greater mammographic
      density.

PG  - 637-40
LID - 10.1097/PAT.0000000000000326 [doi]
AB  - With the emergence of multiple lines of highly effective Human Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) directed therapy, accurate identification of HER2
      positive tumour has become a critical aspect in the histopathological analysis of
      breast cancers. Multifocal invasive breast carcinomas are relatively common, and 
      given the aggressive inherent biology of HER2 positive disease, identification of
      even small tumours with HER2 positive status may be of importance for treatment
      planning. There are currently no clear guidelines as to whether all of these foci
      should be tested for HER2 status. We reviewed the results of 172 patients in whom
      HER2 in situ hybridisation (ISH) testing was performed on at least two
      ipsilateral synchronous invasive carcinomas. Discordant results in different
      invasive foci were relatively uncommon and occurred in only eight (5%) of the 172
      patients. This showed a statistically significant correlation with similarly
      discordant oestrogen receptor (ER) results. In addition HER2 discordance was more
      likely amongst different tumour foci if these arose in distinct and separate
      areas of DCIS. An algorithm based on a combination of College of American
      Pathologists (CAP) recommendation for HER2 testing, differing ER status and
      background DCIS profile may be useful in detecting these discordant cases.

TI  - RAS/MAPK Activation Is Associated with Reduced Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in 
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Therapeutic Cooperation Between MEK and PD-1/PD-L1
      Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.
PG  - 1499-509
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1125 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in the residual disease (RD) of
      triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are
      associated with improved survival, but insight into tumor cell-autonomous
      molecular pathways affecting these features are lacking. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We 
      analyzed TILs in the RD of clinically and molecularly characterized TNBCs after
      NAC and explored therapeutic strategies targeting combinations of MEK inhibitors 
      with PD-1/PD-L1-targeted immunotherapy in mouse models of breast cancer. RESULTS:
      Presence of TILs in the RD was significantly associated with improved prognosis. 
      Genetic or transcriptomic alterations in Ras-MAPK signaling were significantly
      correlated with lower TILs. MEK inhibition upregulated cell surface MHC
      expression and PD-L1 in TNBC cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, combined 
      MEK and PD-L1/PD-1 inhibition enhanced antitumor immune responses in mouse models
      of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the possibility that Ras-MAPK
      pathway activation promotes immune-evasion in TNBC, and support clinical trials
      combining MEK- and PD-L1-targeted therapies. Furthermore, Ras/MAPK activation and
      MHC expression may be predictive biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint
      inhibitors.

TI  - Delay of Treatment Initiation Does Not Adversely Affect Survival Outcome in
      Breast Cancer.
PG  - 962-9
LID - 10.4143/crt.2015.173 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies examining the relationship between time to treatment
      and survival outcome in breast cancer have shown inconsistent results. The aim of
      this study was to analyze the overall impact of delay of treatment initiation on 
      patient survival and to determine whether certain subgroups require more prompt
      initiation of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective
      analysis of stage I-III patients who were treated in a single tertiary
      institution between 2005 and 2008. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox
      proportional hazards regression model were used to evaluate the impact of
      interval between diagnosis and treatment initiation in breast cancer and various 
      subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 1,702 patients were included. Factors associated
      with longer delay of treatment initiation were diagnosis at another hospital,
      medical comorbidities, and procedures performed before admission for surgery. An 
      interval between diagnosis and treatment initiation as a continuous variable or
      with a cutoff value of 15, 30, 45, and 60 days had no impact on disease-free
      survival (DFS). Subgroup analyses for hormone-responsiveness, triple-negative
      breast cancer, young age, clinical stage, and type of initial treatment showed no
      significant association between longer delay of treatment initiation and DFS.
      CONCLUSION: Our results show that an interval between diagnosis and treatment
      initiation of 60 days or shorter does not appear to adversely affect DFS in
      breast cancer.

TI  - HER2 missense mutations have distinct effects on oncogenic signaling and
      migration.
PG  - E6205-14
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1516853112 [doi]
AB  - Recurrent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) missense mutations have
      been reported in human cancers. These mutations occur primarily in the absence of
      HER2 gene amplification such that most HER2-mutant tumors are classified as
      "negative" by FISH or immunohistochemistry assays. It remains unclear whether
      nonamplified HER2 missense mutations are oncogenic and whether they are targets
      for HER2-directed therapies that are currently approved for the treatment of HER2
      gene-amplified breast cancers. Here we functionally characterize HER2 kinase and 
      extracellular domain mutations through gene editing of the endogenous loci in
      HER2 nonamplified human breast epithelial cells. In in vitro and in vivo assays, 
      the majority of HER2 missense mutations do not impart detectable oncogenic
      changes. However, the HER2 V777L mutation increased biochemical pathway
      activation and, in the context of a PIK3CA mutation, enhanced migratory features 
      in vitro. However, the V777L mutation did not alter in vivo tumorigenicity or
      sensitivity to HER2-directed therapies in proliferation assays. Our results
      suggest the oncogenicity and potential targeting of HER2 missense mutations
      should be considered in the context of cooperating genetic alterations and
      provide previously unidentified insights into functional analysis of HER2
      mutations and strategies to target them.

TI  - Loss of COX5B inhibits proliferation and promotes senescence via mitochondrial
      dysfunction in breast cancer.
PG  - 43363-74
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.6222 [doi]
AB  - COX5B, a peripheral subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, has previously
      been reported to maintain the stability of this complex. However, its functions
      and mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression remain unclear. Here, by
      performing SILAC assays in breast cancer cell models and detecting COX5B
      expression in tissues, we found that COX5B expression was elevated in breast
      cancer. Down-regulation of COX5B in breast cancer cell lines can suppress cell
      proliferation and induced cell senescence which was accompanied by elevating
      production of IL-8 and other cytokines. Interestingly, conditioned medium from
      COX5B knockdown cells could promote breast cancer cell migration. Mechanistic
      studies reveal that COX5B silence induces an increase in production of ROS,
      depolarization of MMP and a decrease in ATP. What's more, silence of COX5B leads 
      to metabolic disorders, such as increased glucose uptake and decreased lactate
      secretion. Collectively, our study shows that loss of COX5B induces mitochondrial
      dysfunction and subsequently leads to cell growth suppression and cell
      senescence. Cytokines such as IL-8 secreted by senescent cells may in turn alter 
      the microenvironment which could enhance cell migration. These findings may
      provide a novel paradigm for the treatment which combined anti-cancer drugs with 
      particular cytokine inhibitors such as IL-8 blockers.

TI  - HER2-positivity rates in breast cancer: no variation over time when
      clinicopathological features and testing are stable.
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12404 [doi]
AB  - HER2 status is essential for breast cancer subtyping and for systemic treatment
      decisions as patients with HER2-positive tumours can benefit from anti-HER2
      targeted therapies. However, few data are available on the current HER2-positive 
      breast cancers rate and its evolution across years. Using data from the Cote d'Or
      breast cancer registry, we identified, between 1998 and 2011, 3220 women with
      invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the same laboratory which carries out regular
      internal quality controls and participates in multiannual international quality
      control programmes. Throughout the studied period of time, despite an increase of
      annual breast cancer cases, HER2 positivity rate remained stable (13.1%; P =
      0.495), as did the proportion of tumours with positive hormone receptor status (P
      = 0.467) and the proportion of SBR grade II/III tumours (P = 0.747). Other
      characteristics, less strongly associated with HER2-positive status, showed
      either no annual variation (nodal and metastatic status, tumour size) or an
      annual positive trend (mean age, lobular carcinomas) or an annual negative trend 
      (ductal carcinomas). These data reveal that in a population with stable clinical 
      and pathological characteristics, and with the use of standardised assays, HER2
      positivity rate remains stable over time. These results also emphasise that
      current HER2 positivity rate is lower than initially reported.

TI  - FN14 and GRP94 expression are prognostic/predictive biomarkers of brain
      metastasis outcome that open up new therapeutic strategies.
PG  - 44254-73
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.5471 [doi]
AB  - Brain metastasis is a devastating problem in patients with breast, lung and
      melanoma tumors. GRP94 and FN14 are predictive biomarkers over-expressed in
      primary breast carcinomas that metastasized in brain. To further validate these
      brain metastasis biomarkers, we performed a multicenter study including 318
      patients with breast carcinomas. Among these patients, there were 138 patients
      with metastasis, of whom 84 had brain metastasis. The likelihood of developing
      brain metastasis increased by 5.24-fold (95%CI 2.83-9.71) and 2.55- (95%CI
      1.52-4.3) in the presence of FN14 and GRP94, respectively. Moreover, FN14 was
      more sensitive than ErbB2 (38.27 vs. 24.68) with similar specificity (89.43 vs.
      89.55) to predict brain metastasis and had identical prognostic value than triple
      negative patients (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we used GRP94 and FN14 pathways and 
      GUILD, a network-based disease-gene prioritization program, to pinpoint the genes
      likely to be therapeutic targets, which resulted in FN14 as the main modulator
      and thalidomide as the best scored drug. The treatment of mice with brain
      metastasis improves survival decreasing reactive astrocytes and angiogenesis, and
      down-regulate FN14 and its ligand TWEAK. In conclusion our results indicate that 
      FN14 and GRP94 are prediction/prognosis markers which open up new possibilities
      for preventing/treating brain metastasis.

PG  - 41875-83
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.6174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumor's (SFT) demographic features,
      clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment outcome and disease-specific
      prognostic factors were unexplored comprehensively. METHODS: SEER program was
      used to identify patients diagnosed with SFT from 1973 to 2012. Overall collected
      data were analyzed by using the SPSS 18.0. RESULTS: In total, 804 cases were
      found including 613 cases with SFT-specific mortality and 801 patients were
      analyzed for overall survival (OS). The 3-year disease specific survival (DSS),
      5-year DSS and 10-year DSS were 73.3%, 65.7% and 53.3%. The 3-year OS, 5-year OS 
      and 10-year OS were 71.9%, 63.3% and 47.3%. In the multivariate survival
      analysis, the age > 51 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.851 for DSS, P = 0.024 and HR
      = 1.652 for OS, P = 0.033; Reference [Ref] </= 51 years for DSS and </= 53 years 
      for OS), SEER stage metastasized tumor (HR = 4.269 for DSS, P = 0.000 and HR =
      2.905 for OS, P = 0.028, Ref - localized + regional tumor), pathologic grade III 
      + IV (HR = 2.734 for DSS, P = 0.001 and HR = 2.585 for OS, P = 0.000, Ref - grade
      I + II) were adversely associated with DSS and OS. In addition, surgery was
      favorably associated with DSS (HR = 0.217, P = 0.045, Ref - surgery +
      radiotherapy). CONCLUSIONS: The surgery was an independent prognostic factor for 
      DSS. The patient's age, SEER stage and pathologic grade were SFT-specific
      independent prognostic indicators for DSS and OS.

PG  - 4223-34
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-4121-8 [doi]
AB  - Metastasis is one of the main causes of breast cancer (BCa)-related deaths in
      female. It has been reported that cancer stem cell played an important role in
      metastasis. Here we first revealed a specific role of pyruvate kinase isozymes M2
      (PKM2) in the stemness of breast cancer cells. Breast cancer tissue analysis
      confirmed the upregulation of PKM2 in breast cancer, and high PKM2 levels were
      associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Holoclone assay and
      colony formation assay significantly elucidated the role of PKM2 in the
      self-renewal of breast cancer cells. Moreover, PKM2 elevated the proportion of
      stem cell and the ability of sphere formation in breast cancer cells. PKM2 played
      its functional role in stemness by regulating beta-catenin. Collectively, we
      identified critical roles of PKM2 in the stemness of breast cancer cells which
      may elevate the therapeutic effect on breast cancer patients.

TI  - Predictive value and clinical utility of centrally assessed ER, PgR, and Ki-67 to
      select adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone
      receptor-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer: TEXT and SOFT trials.
PG  - 275-86
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3612-z [doi]
AB  - The SOFT and TEXT randomized phase III trials investigated adjuvant endocrine
      therapies for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early
      breast cancer. We investigated the prognostic and predictive value of centrally
      assessed levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and Ki-67
      expression in women with HER2-negative disease. Of 5707 women enrolled, 4115 with
      HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) disease had ER, PgR, and Ki-67 centrally assessed by
      immunohistochemistry. Breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was defined from
      randomization to first invasive local, regional, or distant recurrence or
      contralateral breast cancer. The prognostic and predictive values of ER, PgR and 
      Ki-67 expression levels were assessed using Cox modeling and STEPP methodology.
      In this HR+/HER2- population, the median ER, PgR, and Ki-67 expressions were 95, 
      90, and 18 % immunostained cells. As most patients had strongly ER-positive
      tumors, the predictive value of ER levels could not be investigated. Lower PgR
      and higher Ki-67 expression were associated with reduced BCFI. There was no
      consistent evidence of heterogeneity of the relative treatment effects according 
      to PgR or Ki-67 expression levels, though there was a greater 5-year absolute
      benefit of exemestane + ovarian function suppression (OFS) versus tamoxifen with 
      or without OFS at lower levels of PgR and higher levels of Ki-67. Women with poor
      prognostic features of low PgR and/or high Ki-67 have greater absolute benefit
      from exemestane + OFS versus tamoxifen + OFS or tamoxifen alone, but individually
      PgR and Ki-67 are of limited predictive value for selecting adjuvant endocrine
      therapy for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.

TI  - Effect of BRCA2 mutation on familial breast cancer survival: A systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 629-34
LID - 10.1007/s11596-015-1481-7 [doi]
AB  - Reports of BRCA2 genetic mutations on the prognosis of familial breast cancer
      (BC) patients have been contradictory. True difference in survival, if it exists,
      would have important implications for genetic counseling and in treatment of
      hereditary BC. The purpose of this study was to compare overall survival rate
      (OSR) among BRCA2 mutation carriers, non-carriers and sporadic BC patients. We
      searched the PUBMED and EMBASE databases and retrieved 4529 articles using
      keywords that included breast cancer, BRCA, prognosis and survival. Nine articles
      were selected for systematic review and among them 6 were included in our
      meta-analysis. We used the fixed and random effect models to calculate the
      summary odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). BRCA2
      mutation carriers had significantly higher long-term OSR than non-carriers
      (OR=0.69 [95% CI=0.5-0.95]), while both short-term and long-term OSR of BRCA2
      mutation carriers did not differ from those of patients with sporadic disease
      (OR=1.11 [95% CI=0.74-1.65]; 0.85 [95% CI=0.38-1.94], respectively). For
      BC-specific survival rate (BCSSR), BRCA2 mutation carriers had a similar BCSSR to
      the non-carriers (OR=0.61 [95% CI=0.28-1.34]). There was no significant
      difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between BRCA2 mutation carriers and
      patients with sporadic disease. Our results suggest that BRCA2 mutation increases
      long-term OSR in hereditary BC, which reminds us a new prospect of management of 
      the disease.

TI  - MAPK Activation Predicts Poor Outcome and the MEK Inhibitor, Selumetinib,
      Reverses Antiestrogen Resistance in ER-Positive High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.
PG  - 935-47
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0534 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although 67% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) express the
      estrogen receptor (ER), most fail antiestrogen therapy. Because MAPK activation
      is frequent in ovarian cancer, we investigated if estrogen regulates MAPK and if 
      MEK inhibition (MEKi) reverses antiestrogen resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      Effects of MEKi (selumetinib), antiestrogen (fulvestrant), or both were assayed
      in ER-positive HGSOC in vitro and in xenografts. Response biomarkers were
      investigated by gene expression microarray and reverse phase protein array
      (RPPA). Genes differentially expressed in two independent primary HGSOC datasets 
      with high versus low pMAPK by RPPA were used to generate a "MAPK-activated gene
      signature." Gene signature components that were reversed by MEKi were then
      identified. RESULTS: High intratumor pMAPK independently predicts decreased
      survival (HR, 1.7; CI > 95%,1.3-2.2; P = 0.0009) in 408 HGSOC from The Cancer
      Genome Atlas. A differentially expressed "MAPK-activated" gene subset was also
      prognostic. "MAPK-activated genes" in HGSOC differ from those in breast cancer.
      Combined MEK and ER blockade showed greater antitumor effects in xenografts than 
      monotherapy. Gene set enrichment analysis and RPPA showed that dual therapy
      downregulated DNA replication and cell-cycle drivers, and upregulated lysosomal
      gene sets. Selumetinib reversed expression of a subset of "MAPK-activated genes" 
      in vitro and/or in xenografts. Three of these genes were prognostic for poor
      survival (P = 0.000265) and warrant testing as a signature predictive of MEKi
      response. CONCLUSIONS: High pMAPK is independently prognostic and may underlie
      antiestrogen failure. Data support further evaluation of fulvestrant and
      selumetinib in ER-positive HGSOC. The MAPK-activated HGSOC signature may help
      identify MEK inhibitor responsive tumors.

TI  - The frequency of osteolytic bone metastasis is determined by conditions of the
      soil, not the number of seeds; evidence from in vivo models of breast and
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 124

AB  - BACKGROUND: While both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the
      frequency of growing skeletal metastases is elevated in individuals with higher
      bone turnover, it is unclear whether this is a result of increased numbers of
      tumour cells arriving in active sites or of higher numbers of tumour cells being 
      induced to divide by the bone micro-environment. Here we have investigated how
      the differences in bone turnover affect seeding of tumour cells and/or
      development of overt osteolytic bone metastasis using in vivo models of
      hormone-independent breast and prostate cancer. METHODS: Cohorts of 6 (young) and
      16 (mature)-week old BALB/c nude mice were culled 1, 7 and 21 days after received
      intracardiac injection of luciferase expressing human prostate (PC3) or breast
      cancer (MDA-MB-231) cell lines labelled with a fluorescent cell membrane dye
      (Vybrant DiD). The presence of growing bone metastases was determined by
      bioluminescence using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and followed by anatomical
      confirmation of tumour metastatic sites post mortem, while the presence of
      individual fluorescently labelled tumour cells was evaluated using two-photon
      microscopy ex vivo. The bone remodelling activities were compared between young
      and mature naive mice (both male and female) using micro-CT analysis, ELISA and
      bone histomorphometry. RESULTS: Both prostate and breast cancer cells generated
      higher numbers of overt skeletal lesions in young mice (~80%) than in mature mice
      (~20%). Although mature mice presented with fewer overt bone metastases, the
      number of tumour cells arriving/colonizing in the tibias was comparable between
      young and mature animals. Young naive mice had lower bone volume but higher bone 
      formation and resorption activities compared to mature animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      studies suggest that higher frequencies of growing osteolytic skeletal metastases
      in these models are linked to increased bone turnover and not to the initial
      number of tumour cells entering the bone microenvironment.

TI  - Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy With Modified Injection Technique:
      High Visualization Rate and Accurate Staging.
PG  - e1790
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000001790 [doi]
AB  - Although the 2009 American Joint Committee on Cancer incorporated the internal
      mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) concept, there has been little
      change in surgical practice patterns because of the low visualization rate of
      internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes (IMSLN) with the traditional radiotracer
      injection technique. In this study, various injection techniques were evaluated
      in term of the IMSLN visualization rate, and the impact of IM-SLNB on the
      diagnostic and prognostic value were analyzed.Clinically, axillary lymph nodes
      (ALN) negative patients (n = 407) were divided into group A (traditional
      peritumoral intraparenchymal injection) and group B (modified periareolar
      intraparenchymal injection). Group B was then separated into group B1 (low
      volume) and group B2 (high volume) according to the injection volume. Clinically,
      ALN-positive patients (n = 63) were managed as group B2. Internal mammary
      sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed for patients with IMSLN visualized.The
      IMSLN visualization rate was significantly higher in group B than that in group A
      (71.1% versus 15.5%, P < 0.001), whereas the axillary sentinel lymph nodes were
      reliably identified in both groups (98.9% versus 98.3%, P = 0.712). With high
      injection volume, group B2 was found to have higher IMSLN visualization rate than
      group B1 (75.1% versus 45.8%, P < 0.001). The IMSLN metastasis rate was only 8.1%
      (12/149) in clinically ALN-negative patients with successful IM-SLNB, and
      adjuvant treatment was altered in a small proportion. The IMSLN visualization
      rate was 69.8% (44/63) in clinically ALN-positive patients with the IMSLN
      metastasis rate up to 20.5% (9/44), and individual radiotherapy strategy could be
      guided with the IM-SLNB results.The modified injection technique (periareolar
      intraparenchymal, high volume, and ultrasound guidance) significantly improved
      the IMSLN visualization rate, making the routine IM-SLNB possible in daily
      practice. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy could provide individual
      minimally invasive staging, prognosis, and decision making of the internal
      mammary radiotherapy, especially for clinically ALN-positive patients.

TI  - Development of novel real-time PCR methodology for quantification of COL11A1 mRNA
      variants and evaluation in breast cancer tissue specimens.
PG  - 694
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1725-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagen XI is a key structural component of the extracellular matrix
      and consists of three alpha chains. One of these chains, the alpha1 (XI), is
      encoded by the COL11A1 gene and is transcribed to four different variants at
      least (A, B, C and E) that differ in the propensity to N-terminal domain
      proteolysis and potentially in the way the extracellular matrix is arranged. This
      could affect the ability of tumor cells to invade the remodeled stroma and
      metastasize. No study in the literature has so far investigated the expression of
      these four variants in breast cancer nor does a method for their accurate
      quantitative detection exist. METHODS: We developed a conventional PCR for the
      general detection of the general COL11A1 transcript and real-time qPCR
      methodologies with dual hybridization probes in the LightCycler platform for the 
      quantitative determination of the variants. Data from 90 breast cancer tissues
      with known histopathological features were collected. RESULTS: The general
      COL11A1 transcript was detected in all samples. The developed methodologies for
      each variant were rapid as well as reproducible, sensitive and specific. Variant 
      A was detected in 30 samples (33 %) and variant E in 62 samples (69 %). Variants 
      B and C were not detected at all. A statistically significant correlation was
      observed between the presence of variant E and lymph nodes involvement (p =
      0.037) and metastasis (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: With the newly developed tools,
      the possibility of inclusion of COL11A1 variants as prognostic biomarkers in
      emerging multiparameter technologies examining tissue RNA expression should be
      further explored.

PG  - 9500-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the methylation status of DNA-binding inhibitor 4 (ID4) in 
      tamoxifen-refractory (TR) breast cancer. METHODS: From January 2012 to December
      2014, breast cancer patients managed by radical mastectomy previously and
      receiving tamoxifen treatment for at least 12 months were enrolled. According to 
      the response to tamoxifen, patients were divided into TR group and
      tamoxifen-sensitive (TS) group. Genomic DNA was isolated from fasting venous
      blood, and methylight technique was applied to determine the methylation status
      of ID4. RESULTS: 43 patients with TS breast cancer and 31 patients with TR breast
      cancer were enrolled. No significant difference between groups was observed in
      term of patients' characteristics, such as age (P=0.693), progesterone receptor
      (P=0.970), menopausal status (P=0.784) and histological type (P=0.537), while the
      stage of cancer in TR group was significantly higher than TS group (P<0.001).
      Compared to TS group, PMR of ID4 was significantly higher in TR group (P=0.002). 
      ROC curve analysis indicated that ID4 yielded an AUC of 0.716 with 77.4%
      sensitivity and 62.79% specificity in distinguishing TR breast cancer at the cut 
      point of 3.8%. The PMR cut point of ID4 was set at 6.8% in survival analysis,
      log-rank test indicated the risk of disease progression was comparable between
      patients with ID4 hypermethylation or hypomethylation (P=0.287). CONCLUSION: ID4 
      hypomethylation is present in TR breast cancer, and it may serve as a potential
      biomarker in distinguishing TR breast cancer. However, the results need further
      validation in larger studies.

      significance.
PG  - 9089-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the expression of TARBP1
      and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: 90 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were included in this 
      study. The tumor and paired adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected. TARBP1
      expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and
      immunohistochemistry. Associations of TARBP1 expression with the
      clinicopathological features were analyzed, and prognosis of HCC patients was
      evaluated. RESULTS: The result show the expression of TARBP1 mRNA in liver cancer
      tissues were higher than in the adjacent normal liver tissues in 10 paired
      samples (P=0.0015). Compared with adjacent normal liver tissues, overexpression
      of TARBP1 was detected in 61.1% (55/90) HCC patients. TARBP1 expression was
      associated with the AJCC tumor stage (P=0.004) and clinical stage (P=0.005), and 
      decreased overall survival (P=0.002). In multivariate analysis, TARBP1 expression
      was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Hazard ratio
      [HR]=2.773, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.542-4.985; P=0.019). CONCLUSIONS:
      TARBP1 is up-regulated in HCC, and the expression of TARBP1 was associated with
      the pathological grading and clinical stage. TARBP1 maybe is an independent
      prognostic marker of HCC patients.

TI  - The NER-related gene GTF2H5 predicts survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancer
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the
      nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the
      6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: In order to test if protein
      levels of GTF2H5 are associated with patients' outcome, we performed GTF2H5
      immunohistochemical staining in 139 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas included
      in tissue microarrays. Upon stratification of cases into high- and low-GTF2H5
      staining categories (> and </= median staining, respectively) Kaplan-Meier and
      log-rank test were used to estimate patients' survival and assess statistical
      differences. We also evaluated the association of GTF2H5 with survival at the
      transcriptional level by using the on-line Kaplan-Meier plotter tool, which
      includes gene expression and survival data of 855 high-grade serous ovarian
      cancer patients from 13 different datasets. Finally, we determined whether stable
      short hairpin RNA-mediated GTF2H5 downregulation modulates cisplatin sensitivity 
      in the SKOV3 and COV504 cell lines by using cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: Low
      expression of GTF2H5 was associated with longer 5-year survival of patients at
      the protein (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.93; p=0.024) and
      transcriptional level (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; p=0.023) in high-grade
      serous ovarian cancer patients. We confirmed the association with 5-year overall 
      survival (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.78; p=0.0007) and also found an association
      with progression-free survival (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96; p=0.026) in a
      homogenous group of 388 high-stage (stages III-IV using the International
      Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system), optimally debulked
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. GTF2H5-silencing induced a decrease of
      the half maximal inhibitory concentration upon cisplatin treatment in
      GTF2H5-silenced ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Low levels of GTF2H5 are
      associated with enhanced prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients
      and may contribute to cisplatin sensitization.

TI  - The Sub-Cellular Localization of WRAP53 Has Prognostic Impact in Breast Cancer.
PG  - e0139965
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0139965 [doi]
AB  - WRAP53 protein controls intracellular trafficking of DNA repair proteins, the
      telomerase enzyme, and splicing factors. Functional loss of the protein has been 
      linked to carcinogenesis, premature aging and neurodegeneration. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the prognostic significance of WRAP53 protein expression
      in breast cancer. A tissue microarray was constructed from primary breast tumors 
      and immunostained by a polyclonal WRAP53 antibody to assess the protein
      expression pattern. Two different patient cohorts with long term follow-up were
      studied; a test- and a validation set of 154 and 668 breast tumor samples
      respectively. Breast cancer patients with tumor cells lacking the expression of
      WRAP53 in the nucleus had a significantly poorer outcome compared to patients
      with tumor cells expressing this protein in the nuclei (HR = 1.95, 95%CI =
      1.09-3.51, p = 0.025). Nuclear localization of WRAP53 was further shown to be an 
      independent marker of prognosis in multivariate analysis (HR = 2.57, 95%CI =
      1.27-5.19, p = 0.008), and also significantly associated with better outcome in
      patients with TP53 mutation. Here we show that the sub-cellular localization of
      the WRAP53 protein has a significant impact on breast cancer survival, and thus
      has a potential as a clinical marker in diagnostics and treatment.

TI  - Rescuing lymphocytes from HLA-G immunosuppressive effects mediated by the tumor
      microenvironment.
PG  - 37385-97
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.6044 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that the antitumor activities of both T and
      natural killer (NK) effector populations are limited by the immunosuppressive
      strategies of tumors. In several malignant transformations, the expression of
      HLA-G by tumor cells rises dramatically, rendering them strongly
      immunosuppressive. In this study, we postulated that the absence of HLA-G
      receptors would prevent the immunosuppressive effects of both soluble and
      membrane-bound HLA-G. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic potential of effector
      NK cells genetically modified to downregulate the expression of ILT2 (HLA-G
      receptor) on their cell surfaces. We have shown that the proliferation of
      modified NK is still dependent on stimulation signals (no malignant
      transformation). ILT2- NK cells proliferate, migrate, and eliminate HLA-G
      negative targets cells to the same extent parental NK cells do. However, in the
      presence of HLA-G positive tumors, ILT2- NK cells exhibit superior proliferation,
      conjugate formation, degranulation, and killing activities compared to parent NK 
      cells. We tested the effectiveness of ILT2- NK cells in vivo using a xenograft
      cancer model and found that silencing ILT2 rescued their anti-tumor activity.We
      believe that combining ILT2- NK cells with existing therapeutic strategies will
      strengthen the antitumor response in cancer patients.

TI  - Down-regulation of miR-129-5p via the Twist1-Snail feedback loop stimulates the
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition and is associated with poor prognosis in breast
      cancer.

AB  - The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in breast
      cancer progression. We found that overexpression of miR-129-5p reversed EMT,
      whereas depletion of miR-129-5p induced EMT in breast cancer cells. We
      demonstrated that Twist1 is a direct target of miR-129-5p. Both Twist1 and Snail 
      transcriptionally suppressed miR-129-5p expression. Levels of miR-129-5p were low
      in breast cancer tissues. miR-129-5p down-regulation correlated with advanced
      clinical stage and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. miR-129-5p
      expression negatively correlated with Twist1 and Snail expression. Thus,
      miR-129-5p down-regulation fosters EMT in breast cancer by increasing
      Twist1-Snail and activating a negative feedback loop.

TI  - Evaluation of health benefits and harms of the breast cancer screening programme 
      in the Basque Country using discrete event simulation.
PG  - 671
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1700-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country
      (BCSPBC) was started in 1996, more than 400,000 women aged 50 to 69 years have
      been invited to participate. Based on epidemiological observations and simulation
      techniques it is possible to extend observed short term data into anticipated
      long term results. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the
      programme through 2011 by quantifying the outcomes in breast cancer mortality,
      life-years gained, false positive results, and overdiagnosis. METHODS: A discrete
      event simulation model was constructed to reproduce the natural history of breast
      cancer (disease-free, pre-clinical, symptomatic, and disease-specific death) and 
      the actual observed characteristics of the screening programme during the
      evaluated period in the Basque women population. Goodness-of-fit statistics were 
      applied for model validation. The screening effects were measured as differences 
      in benefits and harms between the screened and unscreened populations. Breast
      cancer mortality reduction and life-years gained were considered as screening
      benefits, whereas, overdiagnosis and false positive results were assessed as
      harms. Results for a single cohort were also obtained. RESULTS: The screening
      programme yielded a 16 % reduction in breast cancer mortality and a 10 % increase
      in the incidence of breast cancer through 2011. Almost 2 % of all the women in
      the programme had a false positive result during the evaluation period. When a
      single cohort was analysed, the number of deaths decreased by 13 %, and 4 % of
      screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed. Each woman with BC detected by the
      screening programme gained 2.5 life years due to early detection corrected by
      lead time. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen years after the screening programme started, this
      study supports an important decrease in breast cancer mortality due to the
      screening programme, with reasonable risk of overdiagnosis and false positive
      results, and sustains the continuation of the breast cancer screening programme
      in the Basque population.

TI  - AKAP3 correlates with triple negative status and disease free survival in breast 
      cancer.
PG  - 681
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1668-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer-testis antigens are among the new promising biomarkers,
      especially for targeted therapy. Aberrant and specific expression of these
      proteins has been reported in some tumor tissues. Also understanding their
      differential role in normal and cancer tissues may introduce them as new
      candidates for biomarker in cancer. METHODS: AKAP3 expression was investigated in
      162 tumors, normal adjacent and normal tissues of the breast with Real-Time PCR. 
      Also the correlation between the gene expression and clinico-pathologic features 
      of the tumors and treatment regimen was evaluated. RESULTS: There was an
      association between lack of AKAP3 expression in tumor tissues and triple negative
      status (p=. 03). There was also a correlation between lack of this marker and
      tumor size (p = .01) and stage (p = .04). Lack of AKAP3 in normal adjacent
      tissues was associated with poor prognosis. Kaplan Meier plot demonstrated a
      remarkable better 5-year disease free survival in AKAP3 positive normal adjacent 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that this relationship is originated from the
      difference in AKAP3 expression, not therapy distribution between two groups of
      patients. Thus, it may be a proper biomarker candidate for triple negative breast
      cancer patients. Also, testing AKAP3 in normal tissue of the patients may be used
      to predict the outcome of the treatment.

TI  - Prognostic analysis in a Chinese population with T1-2N1 breast cancer: Did
      patients with 1 or 2, and 3 positive axillary lymph nodes have similar survival
      outcomes?
PG  - 569-74
LID - 10.1002/jso.24062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of data examining whether 1-3
      positive lymph nodes patients have similar survival outcomes. The present studies
      separately analyse survival outcomes of T1-2N1 breast cancer patients according
      to the number of positive lymph nodes. METHODS: A total of 1,030 patients with
      T1-2N1 breast cancer were available for analysis. Survival estimates were
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate, and multivariate logistic
      regression models RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed progressively worse
      survival with the increased number of positive lymph nodes. Log-rank test P
      values were 0.003 (1 vs. 2 positive LNs), <0.0001 (1 vs. 3), and 0.006 (2 vs. 3) 
      for recurrence-free survival (RFS). Log-rank test P values were 0.045 (1 vs. 2), 
      <0.0001 (1 vs. 3), and 0.018 (2 vs. 3) for metastasis-free survival (MFS).
      Log-rank test P values were 0.101 (1 vs. 2), <0.0001 (1 vs. 3), and 0.005 (2 vs. 
      3) for overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis showed that 3 and 2 positive 
      lymph nodes had worse survival compared with 1 positive axillary lymph nodes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study does suggest that T1-2N1 patients showed progressively
      worse survival outcomes with the increased number of positive lymph nodes.

TI  - Prolactin and breast cancer: The need to avoid undertreatment of serious
      psychiatric illnesses in breast cancer patients: A review.
PG  - 184-8
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29714 [doi]
AB  - Hyperprolactinemia, defined as a sustained elevation of prolactin (PRL) levels
      greater than 530 mIU/L in women and greater than 424 mIU/L in men, has been
      implicated for a long time in breast cancer etiology and prognosis. Elevated PRL 
      values (approximately 2-3 times higher than the reference values) are a common
      adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, especially with first-generation
      drugs, and most antipsychotics carry a standard warning regarding PRL elevations 
      on their US product labels. These associations foster undertreatment of serious
      psychiatric illnesses in both otherwise healthy patients and cancer patients.
      This review assesses both the preclinical and clinical evidence that has led to
      the hypothesis of PRL's role in breast cancer risk or breast cancer progression. 
      It is concluded that taken together, the published data are unconvincing and
      insufficient to deprive cancer patients in general and breast cancer patients
      specifically of potentially effective antipsychotic or antidepressant medications
      for serious psychiatric indications. We thus call on revised medication
      guidelines to avoid the existing undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses 
      among cancer patients based on an unproven contraindication to psychiatric
      medications. Cancer 2016;122:184-188. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

AB  - DNA methylation variations in gene promoter regions are well documented
      tumor-specific alterations in human malignancies including colon cancer, which
      may influence tumor behavior and clinical outcome. As a subset of colon cancer
      patients does not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, predictive biomarkers are
      desirable. Here, we describe that DNA methylation levels at CpG loci of
      hyaluronoglucosaminidase 2 (HYLA2) could be used to identify stage II and III
      colon cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from 5-flourouracil (5-FU)
      chemotherapy with respect to overall survival and progression-free survival.

TI  - Risk of non-sentinel node metastases in patients with symptomatic cancers
      compared to screen-detected breast cancers.
PG  - 455-9
LID - 10.3109/0284186X.2015.1094186 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic breast cancers may be more aggressive as compared to
      screen-detected breast cancers. This could favor axillary lymph node dissection
      (ALND) in patients with symptomatic breast cancer and positive sentinel nodes.
      METHOD: We identified 955 patients registered in the Danish Breast Cancer
      Cooperative Group (DBCG) Database in 2008 - 2010 with micrometastases (773) or
      isolated tumor cells (ITC) (182) in the sentinel node. Patients were
      cross-checked in the Danish Quality Database of Mammography Screening and 481
      patients were identified as screen-detected cancers. The remaining 474 patients
      were considered as having symptomatic cancers. Multivariate analyses of the risk 
      of non-sentinel node metastases were performed including known risk factors for
      non-sentinel node metastases as well as method of detection. RESULTS: 18% of the 
      patients had metastases in non-sentinel nodes. This was evenly distributed
      between patients with symptomatic and screen-detected cancers; 18.5% vs 17.5% (OR
      1.07; 95% CI 0.77-1.49; p = 0.69). In patients with micrometastases 21% had
      non-sentinel node metastases in the group with symptomatic cancers compared to
      19% of patients with screen-detected cancers. This difference was not significant
      (OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.81-1.65, p = 0.43). Neither the multivariate analysis showed
      an increased risk of non-sentinel node metastases in patients with symptomatic
      cancers compared to screen-detected cancers (OR 1.12, CI 0.77-1.62, p = 0.55). In
      patients with ITCs 8% of patients with symptomatic cancers had non-sentinel node 
      metastases compared to 13% of patients with screen-detected cancers. This
      difference was not significant (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.22-1.54, p = 0.27). In the
      multivariate analysis, the risk of non-sentinel node metastases was still not
      significantly increased in patients with symptomatic cancers compared to
      screen-detected cancers (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.16-1.27, p = 0.13). CONCLUSION: We did
      not find any clinically relevant difference in the risk of non-sentinel node
      metastases between patients with symptomatic and screen-detected cancers with
      micrometastases or ITC in the sentinel node.

TI  - miR-155 Upregulation in Dendritic Cells Is Sufficient To Break Tolerance In Vivo 
      by Negatively Regulating SHIP1.
PG  - 4632-40
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1302941 [doi]
AB  - TLR-induced maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) leads to the production of
      proinflammatory cytokines as well as the upregulation of various molecules
      involved in T cell activation. These are believed to be the critical events that 
      account for the induction of the adaptive immune response. In this study, we have
      examined the role of miR-155 in DC function and the induction of immunity. Using 
      a model in which the transfer of self-Ag-pulsed, TLR-matured DCs can induce a
      functional CD8 T cell response and autoimmunity, we find that DCs lacking miR-155
      have an impaired ability to break immune tolerance. Importantly, transfer of
      self- Ag-pulsed DCs overexpressing miR-155 was sufficient to break tolerance in
      the absence of TLR stimuli. Although these unstimulated DCs induced T cell
      function in vivo, there was no evidence for the upregulation of costimulatory
      ligands or cytokine secretion. Further analysis showed that miR-155 influenced
      the level of the phosphatase SHIP1 in DCs and that the lack of SHIP1 in DCs was
      sufficient to break T cell tolerance in vivo, again in the absence of TLR-induced
      DC maturation. Our study demonstrates that the overexpression of miR-155 in DCs
      is a critical event that is alone sufficient to break self-tolerance and promote 
      a CD8-mediated autoimmune response in vivo. This process is independent of the
      induction of conventional DC maturation markers, indicating that miR-155
      regulation of SHIP represents a unique axis that regulates DC function in vivo.

TI  - Uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy among female BRCA mutation
      carriers: experience at the National Cancer Center of Korea.
PG  - 333-40
LID - 10.1007/s00432-015-2051-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify the uptake rate of risk-reducing
      salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) and the factors affecting this rate among female
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers at the National Cancer Center of Korea. METHODS:
      Between April 2007 and December 2014, 450 women underwent BRCA gene testing, and 
      97 women were found to have BRCA1/2 mutations. Through the review of medical
      records, 42 candidates for RRSO were identified. Of these, 22 underwent RRSO.
      Demographic, clinical, and consultation-related factors were compared between the
      RRSO and non-RRSO groups. RESULTS: The uptake rate of RRSO was 52.4 %. The mean
      time interval between genetic testing and surgery in the RRSO group was 7.3
      months (range 0.6-33.9). The prevalence of amenorrhea was greater in the RRSO
      group than in the non-RRSO group (59.1 % vs. 20.0 %; P = 0.010). More women in
      the RRSO group were consulted with gynecologic oncologists (95.5 % vs. 60.0 %; P 
      = 0.008). In multivariate analyses, amenorrhea at the time of genetic counseling 
      (OR 16.44; 95 % CI 1.16-232.82; P = 0.038) and consultation with gynecologic
      oncologists (OR 30.78; 95 % CI 1.34-707.21; P = 0.032) were identified as factors
      affecting the carrier's decision to undergo RRSO. One patient in the non-RRSO
      group (5.0 %) developed primary peritoneal carcinoma, which was diagnosed 4.6
      years after genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake rate of RRSO among BRCA1/2
      mutation carriers was affected by the presence of amenorrhea and consultation
      with gynecologic oncologists. Gynecologic oncologists with clinical experience
      with ovarian cancer should play a major role in aiding carriers' decision-making 
      concerning RRSO.

AB  - We aimed to identify the factors affecting the successful tumor engraftment in
      breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Further, we investigated
      the prognostic significance and the functional importance of the PDX
      engraftment-related genes in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The
      clinico-pathologic features of 81 breast cancer patients whose tissues were used 
      for PDX transplantation were analyzed to identify the factors affecting the PDX
      engraftment. A gene signature associated with the PDX engraftment was discovered 
      and its clinical importance was tested in a publicly available dataset and in
      vitro assays. Nineteen out of 81 (23.4 %) transplanted tumors were successfully
      engrafted into the PDX models. The engraftment rate was highest in TNBC when
      compared to other subtypes (p = 0.001) and in recurrent or chemotherapy-resistant
      tumors compared to newly diagnosed primary tumors (p = 0.024). PDX tumors
      originated from the TNBC cases showed more rapid tumor growth in mice. Gene
      expression profiling showed that down-regulation of genes involved in the
      tumor-immune interaction was significantly associated with the successful PDX
      engraftment. The engraftment gene signature was associated with worse survival
      outcome when tested in publicly available mRNA datasets of TNBC cases. Among the 
      engraftment-related genes, PHLDA2, TKT, and P4HA2 showed high expression in
      triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, and siRNA-based gene silencing resulted
      in reduced cell invasion and proliferation in vitro. Our results show that the
      PDX engraftment may reflect the aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. Genes
      associated with the PDX engraftment may provide a novel prognostic biomarker and 
      therapeutic targets in TNBC.

AB  - Repurposing of existing cancer drugs to overcome their physical limitations, such
      as insolubility, represents an attractive strategy to achieve enhanced
      therapeutic efficacy and broaden the range of clinical applications. Such an
      approach also promises to offer substantial cost savings in drug development
      efforts. Here we repurposed FDA-approved topical agent bexarotene (Targretin),
      currently in limited use for cutaneous manifestations of T-cell lymphomas, and
      re-engineer it for use in solid tumor applications by forming self-assembling
      nanobubbles. Physico-chemical characterization studies of the novel prodrug
      nanobubbles demonstrated their stability, enhanced target cell internalization
      capability, and highly controlled release profile in response to application of
      focused ultrasound energy. Using an in vitro model of hepatocellular carcinoma
      and an in vivo large animal model of liver ablation, we demonstrate the
      effectiveness of bexarotene prodrug nanobubbles when used in conjunction with
      catheter-based ultrasound, thereby highlighting the therapeutic promise of this
      trimodal approach.

TI  - Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists for Ovarian Function Preservation in
      Premenopausal Women Undergoing Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 65-73
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.3251 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Chemotherapy may result in a detrimental effect on ovarian function
      and fertility in premenopausal women undergoing treatment for early-stage breast 
      cancer (EBC). To minimize risk of harm to ovarian function and fertility for
      patients in this setting, careful considerations should be made.
      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been suggested as an
      alternative to prevent the loss of ovarian function due to exposure to cytotoxic 
      agents, but GnRHa use for ovarian protection in EBC patients is not fully
      resolved. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of GnRHa administered
      concurrently with chemotherapy for ovarian function preservation. DATA SOURCES:
      PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published
      between January 1975 and March 2015. The abstracts of the American Society of
      Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting between 1995 and 2014 and the San Antonio Breast
      Cancer Symposium between 2009 and 2014 were searched as well. STUDY SELECTION:
      Prospective, randomized, clinical trials addressing the role of ovarian
      suppression with GnRHa in preventing early ovarian dysfunction in premenopausal
      women undergoing treatment for EBC were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: 
      Data extraction was performed independently by 2 authors. The methodology and the
      risk of bias were assessment based on the description of randomization method,
      withdrawals, and blinding process. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rate of resumption
      of regular menses after a minimal follow-up period of 6 months following
      chemotherapy was used as a surrogate to assess the incidence of ovarian
      dysfunction. Additional secondary outcomes included hormone levels and number of 
      pregnancies. Risk ratio estimates were calculated based on the number of
      evaluable patients. Analyses were conducted using a random effect model. RESULTS:
      Seven studies were included in this analysis, totaling 1047 randomized patients
      and 856 evaluable patients. The use of GnRHa was associated with a higher rate of
      recovery of regular menses after 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 2.41; 95% CI,
      1.40-4.15; P = .002) and at least 12 months (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.33-2.59; P <
      .001) following the last chemotherapy cycle. The use of GnRHa was also associated
      with a higher number of pregnancies (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.02-3.36; P = .04),
      although this outcome was not uniformly reported and fertility or rate of
      pregnancy was not the primary outcome in any of the trials. CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists given with chemotherapy was
      associated with increased rates of recovery of regular menses in this
      meta-analysis. Evidence was insufficient to assess outcomes related to GnRHa and 
      ovarian function and fertility and needs further investigation.

TI  - High mitochondrial mass identifies a sub-population of stem-like cancer cells
      that are chemo-resistant.
PG  - 30472-86
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.5401 [doi]
AB  - Chemo-resistance is a clinical barrier to more effective anti-cancer therapy. In 
      this context, cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are thought to be chemo-resistant,
      resulting in tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. Our hypothesis is that
      chemo-resistance in CSCs is driven, in part, by enhanced mitochondrial function. 
      Here, we used breast cell lines and metastatic breast cancer patient samples to
      begin to dissect the role of mitochondrial metabolism in conferring the CSC
      phenotype. More specifically, we employed fluorescent staining with MitoTracker
      (MT) to metabolically fractionate these cell lines into mito-high and mito-low
      sub-populations, by flow-cytometry. Interestingly, cells with high mitochondrial 
      mass (mito-high) were specifically enriched in a number of known CSC markers,
      such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and they were ESA+/CD24-/low and 
      formed mammospheres with higher efficiency. Large cell size is another
      independent characteristic of the stem cell phenotype; here, we observed a
      >2-fold increase in mitochondrial mass in large cells (>12-mum), relative to the 
      smaller cell population (4-8-mum). Moreover, the mito-high cell population showed
      a 2.4-fold enrichment in tumor-initiating cell activity, based on limiting
      dilution assays in murine xenografts. Importantly, primary human breast CSCs
      isolated from patients with metastatic breast cancer or a patient derived
      xenograft (PDX) also showed the co-enrichment of ALDH activity and mitochondrial 
      mass. Most significantly, our investigations demonstrated that mito-high cells
      were resistant to paclitaxel, resulting in little or no DNA damage, as measured
      using the comet assay. In summary, increased mitochondrial mass in a
      sub-population of breast cancer cells confers a stem-like phenotype and
      chemo-resistance. As such, our current findings have important clinical
      implications for over-coming drug resistance, by therapeutically targeting the
      mito-high CSC population.

PG  - 645-63

AB  - Breast cancer is the most-common cancer among women worldwide, and over one-third
      of all cases diagnosed annually are nonpalpable at diagnosis. The increasingly
      widespread implementation of breast-screening programmes, combined with the use
      of advanced imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will
      further increase the numbers of patients diagnosed with this disease. The current
      standard management for nonpalpable breast cancer is localized surgical excision 
      combined with axillary staging, using sentinel-lymph-node biopsy in the
      clinically and radiologically normal axilla. Wire-guided localization (WGL)
      during mammography is a method that was developed over 40 years ago to enable
      lesion localization preoperatively; this technique became the standard of care in
      the absence of a better alternative. Over the past 20 years, however, other
      technologies have been developed as alternatives to WGL in order to overcome the 
      technical and outcome-related limitations of this technique. This Review
      discusses the techniques available for the surgical management of nonpalpable
      breast cancer; we describe their advantages and disadvantages, and highlight
      future directions for the development of new technologies.

TI  - Efficient Genotyping of KRAS Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using a
      Multiplexed Droplet Digital PCR Approach.
PG  - e0139074
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0139074 [doi]
AB  - Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) can be used to detect low frequency mutations in
      oncogene-driven lung cancer. The range of KRAS point mutations observed in NSCLC 
      necessitates a multiplex approach to efficient mutation detection in circulating 
      DNA. Here we report the design and optimisation of three discriminatory ddPCR
      multiplex assays investigating nine different KRAS mutations using PrimePCR ddPCR
      Mutation Assays and the Bio-Rad QX100 system. Together these mutations account
      for 95% of the nucleotide changes found in KRAS in human cancer. Multiplex
      reactions were optimised on genomic DNA extracted from KRAS mutant cell lines and
      tested on DNA extracted from fixed tumour tissue from a cohort of lung cancer
      patients without prior knowledge of the specific KRAS genotype. The multiplex
      ddPCR assays had a limit of detection of better than 1 mutant KRAS molecule in
      2,000 wild-type KRAS molecules, which compared favourably with a limit of
      detection of 1 in 50 for next generation sequencing and 1 in 10 for Sanger
      sequencing. Multiplex ddPCR assays thus provide a highly efficient methodology to
      identify KRAS mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.

TI  - Ethnic differences in breast cancer survival in New Zealand: contributions of
      differences in screening, treatment, tumor biology, demographics and
      comorbidities.
PG  - 1813-24
LID - 10.1007/s10552-015-0674-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the breast cancer survival disparity between Indigenous 
      Maori and non-Indigenous European women in New Zealand, and quantified the
      relative contributions of patient, tumor and healthcare system factors toward
      this disparity. METHODS: All women diagnosed with breast cancer in Waikato, New
      Zealand, during 1999-2012 were identified from the Waikato Breast Cancer
      Register. Cancer-specific survivals were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival
      curves, while contributions of different factors toward the survival disparity
      were quantified with serial Cox proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS: Of the
      2,679 women included in this study, 2,260 (84.4%) were NZ European and 419
      (15.6%) were Maori. Compared with NZ European women, Maori women had a
      significantly higher age-adjusted cancer-specific mortality (HR 2.02, 95% CI
      1.59-2.58) with significantly lower 5-year (86.8 vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001) and
      10-year (79.9 vs. 66.9%, p < 0.001%) crude cancer-specific survivals. Stage at
      diagnosis made the greatest contribution (approximately 25-40%), while screening,
      treatment and patient factors (i.e., comorbidity, obesity and smoking)
      contributed by approximately 15% each toward the survival disparity. The final
      model accounted for almost all of the cancer survival disparity (HR 1.07, 95% CI 
      0.80-1.44). CONCLUSIONS: Maori women experience an age-adjusted risk of death
      from breast cancer, which is more than twice that for NZ European women.
      Equity-focussed improvements in health care, including increasing mammographic
      screening coverage and providing equitable quality and timely cancer care, may
      improve the survival disparity between Maori and NZ European women.

PG  - 881-7
LID - 10.3233/CBM-150532 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) expression profiles might be useful novel
      biomarkers for tumor diagnostic and histological characterization. OBJECTIVE:
      Associations of miR-146 expression and breast cancer in very young women needed
      to be elucidated. METHODS: We investigated expressions of miR-146a, miR-146b and 
      IL-6 in tissues between 120 young women with primary breast cancer and 130
      patients with breast fibroadenoma by RT-PCR. The associations between the
      expression of miR-146, IL-6 and clinical parameters of breast cancer were
      analyzed. RESULTS: Levels of miR-146a and miR-146b in breast cancer tissues were 
      lower while level of IL-6 was higher compared to the fibroadenoma tissues and
      pericancerous breast tissues (P< 0.05). Positive associations were found between 
      levels of miR-146a/b and IL-6 in breast cancer tissues and ER-PgR-, HER2/neu-,
      Ki-67 index >/= 20%, tumor size > 2 cm, positive distant metastasis and lymph
      node metastasis, advanced clinical TNM stages (III-IV) and basal-like phenotype
      (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Down-regulations of miR-146a and miR-146b expression in
      breast tissues were related to development and deterioration of breast cancer.

AB  - Brain metastasis is a significant unmet clinical problem in breast cancer
      treatment. It is always associated with poor prognosis and high morbidity.
      Recently, Slit2/Robo1 pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the
      progression of breast carcinoma. However, until present, there are no convincing 
      reports that suggest whether the Slit2/Robo1 axis has any role in brain
      metastasis of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the correlation
      between Slit2/Robo1 signaling and breast cancer brain metastasis for the first
      time. Our results demonstrated that (1) Invasive ductal carcinoma patients with
      low expression of Slit2 or Robo1 exhibited worse prognosis and brain-specific
      metastasis, but not liver, bone or lung. (2) Lower expression of Slit2 and Robo1 
      were observed in patients with brain metastasis, especially in their brain
      metastasis tumors, compared with patients without brain metastasis. (3) The
      interval from diagnosis of breast cancer to brain metastasis and brain metastasis
      to death were both much shorter in patients with low expression of Slit2 or Robo1
      compared with the high expression group. Overall, our findings indicated that
      Slit2/Robo1 axis possibly be regarded as a significant clinical parameter for
      predicting brain metastasis in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Ras Signaling Is a Key Determinant for Metastatic Dissemination and Poor Survival
      of Luminal Breast Cancer Patients.
PG  - 4960-72
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2992 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is associated with alterations in a number of growth factor and
      hormone-regulated signaling pathways. Mouse models of metastatic breast cancer
      typically feature mutated oncoproteins that activate PI3K, Stat3, and Ras
      signaling, but the individual and combined roles of these pathways in breast
      cancer progression are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the
      relationship between oncogenic pathway activation and breast cancer subtype by
      analyzing mouse mammary tumor formation in which each pathway was activated
      singly or pairwise. All three oncogenes showed cooperation during primary tumor
      formation, but efficient dissemination was only dependent on Ras. In addition,
      transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Ras induced adenocarcinomas with
      molecular characteristics related to human basal-like and HER2(+) tumors. In
      contrast, Ras combined with PIK3CA(H1047R), an oncogenic mutant linked to
      ERalpha(+)/luminal breast cancer in humans, induced metastatic luminal B-like
      tumors. Consistent with these data, elevated Ras signaling was associated with
      basal-like and HER2(+) subtype tumors in humans and showed a statistically
      significant negative association with estrogen receptor (ER) signaling across all
      breast cancer. Despite this, there are luminal tumors with elevated Ras
      signaling. Importantly, when considered as a continuous variable, Ras pathway
      activation was strongly linked to reduced survival of patients with ERalpha(+)
      disease independent of PI3K or Stat3 activation. Therefore, our studies suggest
      that Ras activation is a key determinant for dissemination and poor prognosis of 
      ERalpha(+)/luminal breast cancer in humans, and hormone therapy supplemented with
      Ras-targeting agents may be beneficial for treating this aggressive subtype.

TI  - An ecological measure of immune-cancer colocalization as a prognostic factor for 
      breast cancer.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/s13058-015-0638-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Abundance of immune cells has been shown to have prognostic and
      predictive significance in many tumor types. Beyond abundance, the spatial
      organization of immune cells in relation to cancer cells may also have
      significant functional and clinical implications. However there is a lack of
      systematic methods to quantify spatial associations between immune and cancer
      cells. METHODS: We applied ecological measures of species interactions to digital
      pathology images for investigating the spatial associations of immune and cancer 
      cells in breast cancer. We used the Morisita-Horn similarity index, an ecological
      measure of community structure and predator-prey interactions, to quantify the
      extent to which cancer cells and immune cells colocalize in whole-tumor histology
      sections. We related this index to disease-specific survival of 486 women with
      breast cancer and validated our findings in a set of 516 patients from different 
      hospitals. RESULTS: Colocalization of immune cells with cancer cells was
      significantly associated with a disease-specific survival benefit for all breast 
      cancers combined. In HER2-positive subtypes, the prognostic value of
      immune-cancer cell colocalization was highly significant and exceeded those of
      known clinical variables. Furthermore, colocalization was a significant
      predictive factor for long-term outcome following chemotherapy and radiotherapy
      in HER2 and Luminal A subtypes, independent of and stronger than all known
      clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates how ecological methods
      applied to the tumor microenvironment using routine histology can provide
      reproducible, quantitative biomarkers for identifying high-risk breast cancer
      patients. We found that the clinical value of immune-cancer interaction patterns 
      is highly subtype-specific but substantial and independent to known
      clinicopathologic variables that mostly focused on cancer itself. Our approach
      can be developed into computer-assisted prediction based on histology samples
      that are already routinely collected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant triton tumor (MTT) is a rare and histological complexity
      characterized by a mixture of peripheral nerve sheath tumors and with
      rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. It follows a particularly malignant course.
      CASE PRESENTATION: In the present study, we report the first MTT of epididymis.
      The patient is a 22-year-old male presented with swelling in the left scrotum
      over a 2-month period. He did not have the history or symptoms of
      neurofibromatosis type 1. A mass measured about 3 cm x 4 cm was found in the left
      epididymis by ultrasound and CT scan. It was diagnosed as epididymis tumor and
      underwent exploration; intraoperative frozen section was diagnosed malignant
      tumor and treated with radical orchidoepididymectomy. The pathological report was
      malignant triton tumor. Despite taken high-dose radiation therapy and followed by
      chemotherapy for four cycles, he was died of progressive disease with multiple
      metastases 26 months after surgery. The clinic pathologic characteristics and
      optimal treatment strategy are reviewed.

TI  - Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast
      Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy and 2 or More HER2-Targeted Agents:
      Results From the T-PAS Expanded Access Study.
PG  - 357-64
LID - 10.1097/PPO.0000000000000144 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has improved
      outcomes in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), as demonstrated in phase III
      studies. Few data approximating its use in routine clinical practice are
      available. METHODS: The T-DM1 Patient Access Study was an expanded-access,
      multicenter study of T-DM1 in US patients with pretreated HER2-positive locally
      advanced breast cancer or MBC. The primary endpoint was safety. The secondary
      endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among patients with
      measurable disease at baseline. Data are presented for the first 215 enrolled
      patients. RESULTS: The median number of prior systemic MBC agents was 8 (range,
      3-23). At baseline, median left ventricular ejection fraction was 60%, and 52.6% 
      of patients had nonclinically significant cardiovascular disease. Median T-DM1
      treatment duration was 5.0 months (range, 0-29 months; median follow-up, 5.9
      months), with 18.6% having received more than 18 cycles. The most common
      any-grade adverse events were fatigue (50.7%) and nausea (38.1%). Adverse events 
      of grade 3 or greater were reported in 46.5%, most commonly thrombocytopenia and 
      platelet count decrease (10.2%). Bleeding of grade 3 or greater was reported in 4
      patients (1.9%). Cardiac dysfunction (primarily asymptomatic left ventricular
      ejection fraction decreases) was reported in 14 patients (6.5%). Among those with
      measurable disease at baseline (n = 172), objective response rate was 25.6% (95% 
      confidence interval, 19.2%-32.8%). DISCUSSION: The safety profile of T-DM1 in
      this real-world setting of heterogeneous, HER2-positive, pretreated, locally
      advanced breast cancer or MBC was comparable with that reported in phases II and 
      III studies of similar patient populations. T-DM1 was efficacious with no new
      safety signals.

TI  - Outcomes of special histotypes of breast cancer after adjuvant endocrine therapy 
      with letrozole or tamoxifen in the monotherapy cohort of the BIG 1-98 trial.
PG  - 2442-9
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the outcomes of postmenopausal women with hormone
      receptor-positive, early breast cancer with special histotypes (mucinous,
      tubular, or cribriform) enrolled in the monotherapy cohort of the BIG 1-98 trial.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The intention-to-treat BIG 1-98 monotherapy cohort (5 years
      of therapy with tamoxifen or letrozole) included 4922 women, of whom 4091 had
      central pathology review. Histotype groups were defined as: mucinous (N = 100),
      tubular/cribriform (N = 83), ductal (N = 3257), and other (N = 651). Of 183 women
      with either mucinous or tubular/cribriform tumors, 96 were randomly assigned to
      letrozole and 87 to tamoxifen. Outcomes assessed were disease-free survival
      (DFS), overall survival (OS), breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), and distant
      recurrence-free interval (DRFI). Median follow-up in the analytic cohort was 8.1 
      years. RESULTS: Women with tubular/cribriform breast cancer had the best outcomes
      for all end points compared with the other three histotypes, and had less breast 
      cancer recurrence (97.5% 5-year BCFI) than those with mucinous (93.5%), ductal
      (88.9%), or other (89.9%) histotypes. Patients with mucinous or
      tubular/cribriform carcinoma had better DRFI (5-year rates 97.8% and 98.8%,
      respectively) than those with ductal (90.9%) or other (92.1%) carcinomas. Within 
      the subgroup of women with special histotypes, we observed a nonsignificant
      increase in the hazard of breast cancer recurrence with letrozole [hazard
      (letrozole versus tamoxifen): 3.31, 95% confidence interval 0.94-11.7; P = 0.06].
      CONCLUSIONS: Women with mucinous or tubular/cribriform breast cancer have better 
      outcomes than those with other histotypes, although the observation is based on a
      limited number of events. In postmenopausal women with these histotypes, the
      magnitude of the letrozole advantage compared with tamoxifen may not be as large 
      in patients with mucinous or tubular/cribriform disease. CLINICALTRIALSGOV:

TI  - Background parenchymal enhancement in breast MRI before and after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy: correlation with tumour response.
PG  - 1590-6
LID - 10.1007/s00330-015-4011-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To correlate the decrease in background parenchymal enhancement (BPE)
      and tumour response measured with MRI in breast cancer patients treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: One hundred and forty-six MRI
      examinations of 73 patients with 80 biopsy-proven breast cancers who underwent
      breast MRI before and after NAC were retrospectively analysed. All images were
      reviewed by two blinded readers, who classified BPE into categories (BEC; 1 =
      minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked) before and after NAC.
      Histopathological and morphological tumour responses were analysed and compared. 
      RESULTS: The distribution of BEC 1/2/3/4 was 25/46/18/11 % before and 78/20/2/0 %
      after NAC. On average, BPE decreased by 0.87 BEC. Cohen's kappa showed
      substantial agreement (k = 0.73-0.77) before and moderate agreement (k =
      0.43-0.60) after NAC and moderate agreement (k = 0.62-0.60) concerning the change
      in BEC. Correlating the change in BPE with tumour response, the average decrease 
      in BEC was 1.3 in cases of complete remission, 0.83 in cases with partial
      response, 0.85 in cases with stable disease and 0.40 in cases with progressive
      disease. Correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between the
      decrease in BEC and tumour response (r = -0.24, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: BPE
      decreased by, on average, 0.87 BEC following NAC for breast cancer. The degree of
      BPE reduction seemed to correlate with tumour response. KEY POINTS: * BPE
      decreases by an average of 0.87 categories under neoadjuvant chemotherapy. * The 
      reduction of BPE following neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlates with the tumour
      response. * The classification of the BPE shows good agreement among trained
      readers.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy using indocyanine green in oral/oropharyngeal cancer.
PG  - 278
LID - 10.1186/s12957-015-0691-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Radioactive tracer-based detection has been proposed as a standard
      procedure in identifying sentinel nodes for cN0 oral/oropharyngeal carcinoma.
      However, access to radioactive isotopes may be limited in some surgical centers, 
      and there is potential risk of the radioactive tracers to the operators. This
      study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of near-infrared fluorescence
      imaging with indocyanine green combined with blue dye mapping in sentinel node
      biopsy for cN0 oral/oropharyngeal carcinoma. METHODS: Twenty-six cases of
      previously untreated oral/oropharyngeal carcinoma staged cT1-2N0M0 were enrolled 
      in this study. One milliliter of indocyanine green (5 mg/ml) and 1.5 ml of
      methylene blue (1 mg/ml) were injected sequentially around the primary tumor in a
      four-quadrant pattern before skin incision. After elevation of the platysma flap 
      and posterior retraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, fluorescence images
      were taken with a near-infrared detector, with special attention paid to any
      blue-dyed lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identified first with fluorescent hot spots
      with or without blue dye were defined as sentinel nodes, and they were harvested 
      and sent for pathologic study. RESULTS: Sentinel nodes were successfully
      harvested in all 26 cases. The number of sentinel nodes (SNs) per case varied
      from 1 to 9, with an average of 3.4. Routine pathology demonstrated occult
      metastasis exclusively in SNs in four cases (15.4 %). No tracer-associated side
      effects occurred in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Near-infrared imaging using
      indocyanine green combined with methylene blue mapping is a feasible and reliable
      new method for SN biopsy in cN0 oral/oropharyngeal carcinoma.

TI  - Circulating Tumor Cells and Recurrence After Primary Systemic Therapy in Stage
      III Inflammatory Breast Cancer.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djv250 [doi]
LID - djv250 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare and aggressive, with poor survival.
      While circulating tumor cells (CTCs) predict outcome in non-IBC patients, little 
      data exists regarding their prognostic significance in IBC. This prospective
      study analyzed blood samples for CTCs from 63 stage III IBC patients to determine
      if CTCs present after primary systemic chemotherapy predicted relapse. CTC
      identification was not associated with tumor characteristics, lymph node
      positivity, or complete pathologic response to systemic therapy. At mean
      follow-up of 38 months, multivariable analysis demonstrated that detection of one
      or more CTCs predicted shortened relapse-free (log-rank P = 0.005, hazard ratio
      [HR] = 4.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.67 to 10.67, Cox P = 0.002) but not
      overall survival (log-rank P = 0.54, HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.41 to 5.79, Cox P =
      0.53). All statistical tests were two-sided. In this study, CTCs after primary
      chemotherapy identified IBC patients at high risk for relapse.

TI  - Prognostic Implications of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Association With

AB  - BACKGROUND: The immune system might influence breast cancer (BC) prognosis.
      However, the relationship between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) profiles remains unclear with respect to BC
      subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the relationship between TIL
      profiles for CD8+ and forkhead box P3-positive (FOXP3+) and PD-L1 expression in
      primary tumor tissue using immunohistochemistry and the clinical outcomes in 2
      patient cohorts at the National Cancer Center: 256 patients diagnosed with
      early-stage BC from January 2001 to December 2005 and 77 hormone receptor
      (HR)-negative BC patients diagnosed from January 2006 to December 2008. Clinical 
      data were collected, including HR status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 
      2 expression, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The
      median patient age was 47 years (range, 28-78), and the median follow-up period
      was 9.8 years. Of the 333 patients, 186 (55.9%) had HR-positive and 125 (37.5%)
      had node-positive BC. We found a strong positive correlation between CD8+ TILs
      and FOXP3+ TILs (P < .001). CD8+ TILs were more abundant in tumors with low PD-L1
      expression (P < .001), although no association was found between FOXP3+ TILs and 
      PD-L1 expression. More CD8+ TILs were present in HR-negative than in HR-positive 
      BC (P < .001), and PD-L1 expression was more frequent in HR-positive BC (P <
      .001). A greater number of CD8+ TILs (increase in quartile) was strongly
      associated with OS (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.95; P =
      .03) only in HR-negative BC when adjusted for various clinical factors. PD-L1
      expression and FOXP3+ TILs did not exhibit such associations. CONCLUSION: Higher 
      CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration was related to lower PD-L1 expression and higher
      FOXP3+ TIL infiltration in BC. Higher CD8+ TIL expression was associated with
      prolonged survival only in those with HR-negative BC.

TI  - Locoregional treatment versus no treatment of the primary tumour in metastatic
      breast cancer: an open-label randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of locoregional treatment in women with metastatic breast
      cancer at first presentation is unclear. Preclinical evidence suggests that such 
      treatment might help the growth of metastatic disease, whereas many retrospective
      analyses in clinical cohorts have suggested a favourable effect of locoregional
      treatment in these patients. We aimed to compare the effect of locoregional
      treatment with no treatment on outcome in women with metastatic breast cancer at 
      initial presentation. METHODS: In this open-label, randomised controlled trial,
      we recruited previously untreated patients (</=65 years of age with an estimated 
      remaining life expectancy of at least 1 year) presenting with de-novo metastatic 
      breast cancer from Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Patients were randomly
      assigned (1:1) to receive locoregional treatment directed at their primary breast
      tumour and axillary lymph nodes, or no locoregional treatment, by a
      computer-generated block randomisation sequence (block size of four).
      Randomisation was stratified by site of distant metastases, number of metastatic 
      lesions, and hormone receptor status. Patients with resectable primary tumour in 
      the breast that could be treated with endocrine therapy were randomly assigned
      upfront, whereas those with an unresectable primary tumour were planned for
      chemotherapy before randomisation. Of the patients who had chemotherapy before
      randomisation, we randomly assigned patients who had an objective tumour response
      after six to eight cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall
      survival analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00193778. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7, 2005, and Jan 18, 2013,
      of the 716 women presenting with de-novo metastatic breast cancer, we randomly
      assigned 350 patients: 173 to locoregional treatment and 177 to no locoregional
      treatment. At data cut-off of Nov 1, 2013, median follow-up was 23 months (IQR
      12.2-38.7) with 235 deaths (locoregional treatment n=118, no locoregional
      treatment n=117). Median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI 15.98-22.46) in
      the locoregional treatment group and 20.5 months (16.96-23.98) in the
      no-locoregional treatment group (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.81-1.34; p=0.79), and the
      corresponding 2-year overall survival was 41.9% (95% CI 33.9-49.7) in the
      locoregional treatment group and 43.0% (35.2-50.8) in the no locoregional
      treatment group. The only adverse event noted was wound infection related to
      surgery in one patient in the locoregional treatment group. INTERPRETATION: There
      is no evidence to suggest that locoregional treatment of the primary tumour
      affects overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer at initial
      presentation who have responded to front-line chemotherapy, and this procedure
      should not be part of routine practice.

TI  - Integrative proteomic and gene expression analysis identify potential biomarkers 
      for adjuvant trastuzumab resistance: analysis from the Fin-her phase III
      randomized trial.
PG  - 30306-16
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.5080 [doi]
AB  - Trastuzumab is a remarkably effective therapy for patients with human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)--positive breast cancer (BC). However, not all
      women with high levels of HER2 benefit from trastuzumab. By integrating mRNA and 
      protein expression data from Reverse-Phase Protein Array Analysis (RPPA) in
      HER2-positive BC, we developed gene expression metagenes that reflect pathway
      activation levels. Next we assessed the ability of these metagenes to predict
      resistance to adjuvant trastuzumab using gene expression data from two
      independent datasets.10 metagenes passed external validation (false discovery
      rate [fdr] < 0.05) and showed biological relevance with their pathway of origin. 
      These metagenes were further screened for their association with trastuzumab
      resistance. An association with trastuzumab resistance was observed and validated
      only for the AnnexinA1 metagene (ANXA1). In the randomised phase III Fin-her
      study, tumours with low levels of the ANXA1 metagene showed a benefit from
      trastuzumab (multivariate: hazard ratio [HR] for distant recurrence = 0.16[95%CI 
      0.05-0.5]; p = 0.002; fdr = 0.03), while high expression levels of the ANXA1
      metagene were associated with a lack of benefit to trastuzmab (HR = 1.29[95%CI
      0.55-3.02]; p = 0.56). The association of ANXA1 with trastuzumab resistance was
      successfully validated in an independent series of subjects who had received
      trastuzumab with chemotherapy (Log Rank; p = 0.01).In conclusion, in
      HER2-positive BC, some proteins are associated with distinct gene expression
      profiles. Our findings identify the ANXA1metagene as a novel biomarker for
      trastuzumab resistance.

PG  - 1582-9
LID - 10.1111/cas.12813 [doi]
AB  - PIK3CA is an oncogene that encodes the p110alpha component of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); it is the second most frequently mutated
      gene following the TP53 gene. In the clinical setting, PIK3CA mutations may have 
      favorable prognostic value for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients
      and, during the past few years, PIK3CA mutations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have
      attracted attention as a potential noninvasive biomarker of cancer. However,
      there are few reports on the clinical implications of PIK3CA mutations for TNBC
      patients. We investigated the PIK3CA major mutation status of cfDNA as a
      noninvasive biomarker of cancer using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction
      (ddPCR), which has high level sensitivity and specificity for cancer mutation, in
      early-stage 49 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. A total of 12
      (24.4%) of 49 patients had PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA. In a median follow up of
      54.4 months, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA had significant impacts on
      relapse-free survival (RFS; P = 0.0072) and breast cancer-specific survival
      (BCSS; P = 0.016), according to the log-lank test. In a Cox proportional hazards 
      model, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA had significant prognostic value
      in the univariate and multivariate analysis. Additionally, the presence of PIK3CA
      mutations of cfDNA was significantly correlated with positive androgen receptor
      phosphorylated form depending on PI3K signaling pathway (pAR) which is
      independent favorable prognostic factors of TNBC. We demonstrated that the
      presence of PIK3CA major mutations of cfDNA could be a discriminatory predictor
      of RFS and BCSS in early-stage TNBC patients and it was associated with PI3K
      pathway-dependent AR phosphorylation.

TI  - Current directions in behavioral medicine research on genetic testing for disease
      susceptibility: introduction to the special section.
PG  - 701-5
LID - 10.1007/s10865-015-9674-x [doi]
AB  - The aim of this special section is to showcase research contributing to our
      understanding of factors influencing decisions to undergo genetic testing and the
      impact of the genetic testing process on health-related behaviors of tested
      individuals. The first two articles report studies investigating factors
      associated with interest in genetic testing and acceptance of test results
      (Sherman et al. in J Behav Med doi: 10.1007/s10865-015-9630-9 , 2015; Taber et
      al. in J Behav Med doi: 10.1007/s10865-015-9642-5 , 2015b). The next two papers
      address the unique contribution of genetic risk information to understanding risk
      beyond genetic counseling alone (Heiniger et al. in J Behav Med doi
      10.1007/s10865-015-9632-7 , 2015; Taber et al. in J Behav Med doi:
      10.1007/s10865-015-9648-z , 2015a). The final three articles investigate the
      effects of genetic risk information on beliefs about disease control and
      prevention (Aspinwall et al. in J Behav Med doi: 10.1007/s10865-015-9631-8 ,
      2015; Kelly et al. in J Behav Med doi 10.1007/s10865-014-9613-2 , 2014; Myers et 
      al. in J Behav Med doi: 10.1007/s10865-015-9626-5 , 2015). Collectively, the
      special section of papers highlights the diverse ways in which behavioural
      medicine contributes to our understanding of genetic testing for disease risk,
      and points to the value of further research to better understand ways in which
      individuals perceive, interpret and respond to genetic risk information.

TI  - Gly972Arg variant of insulin receptor substrate 1 gene and colorectal cancer risk
      in overweight/obese subjects.
PG  - e68-72
LID - 10.5301/jbm.5000159 [doi]
LID - 5CE73431-2B10-417A-B0BD-C065F54917DB [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the major role of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) in
      colorectal cancer (CRC), we investigated whether genetic variants in ghrelin
      (GHRL), resistin (RETN) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) were associated
      with CRC risk. METHODS: This study was conducted as a case-control study, and 750
      subjects, including 438 controls and 312 patients with CRC, were enrolled and
      genotyped using the PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: No significant differences were
      observed for GHRL (rs696217), RETN (rs3745367) and IRS1 (rs1801278, Gly972Arg or 
      G972R) gene variants between the cases and controls. However, the IRS1 G972R R
      allele compared with the G allele and the G972R RR+GR genotype compared with the 
      GG genotype appeared to be markers of decreased CRC susceptibility in the
      overweight/obese subjects (p = 0.024; odds ratio [OR] = 0.42, 95% confidence
      interval [95% CI], 0.20-0.91; and p = 0.048; OR = 0.42, 95% CI, 0.17-0.99,
      respectively). Furthermore, the R allele and RR+GR genotype were also associated 
      with decreased risks for obesity in the patients with CRC (p = 0.007; OR = 0.35, 
      95% CI, 0.15-0.77; and p = 0.015; OR = 0.35, 95% CI, 0.15-0.72, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with previous studies, our findings suggest that the
      IRS1 G972R R allele and RR+GR genotype have protective effects for CRC in
      overweight/obese patients and for obesity in patients with CRC. Nevertheless,
      further studies are required to confirm these findings.

TI  - Trastuzumab in the treatment of elderly patients with early breast cancer:
      Results from an observational study in Germany.

LID - 10.1016/j.jgo.2015.06.003 [doi]
LID - S1879-4068(15)00078-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In elderly patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, few data on
      efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment exists since older
      patients were in general excluded from large randomized studies. This prospective
      observational study aimed to confirm the beneficial findings from pivotal trials 
      in age cohorts >/=65 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were no restrictions for
      recruitment with respect to age or concomitant/sequential adjuvant medication.
      Long-term relapse/survival status of the patients was assessed once a year.
      RESULTS: Among the 3940 evaluable patients enrolled between 2006 and 2012 at 339 
      institutions, 507 were aged between 65 and 69 years, with another 507 patients
      >/=70 years. Elderly patients suffered from significantly more advanced primary
      tumors. Preceding or concomitant chemotherapy showed decreasing aggressiveness
      with patient's age. Trastuzumab treatment was stopped prematurely in only 11% of 
      the elderly, but more often than in younger patients (p=0.0008). With 453 events 
      hitherto reported, elderly patients did not exhibit an inferior relapse-free
      survival when adjusted for other relevant prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.01 
      per year; p=0.24). Three-year overall survival was significantly lower in the
      population older than 64 years than in younger patients (94.2% vs. 96.8%,
      p=0.0011). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our population of elderly patients
      treated with adjuvant trastuzumab is the largest analyzed so far. The beneficial 
      long-term results were comparable to those in the younger cohorts. Although the
      risk of cardiotoxicity increased significantly with age, it also remained
      manageable in older patients. Thus, chronological age alone should not preclude
      HER2 antibody treatment.

TI  - Prognostic significance of axillary dissection in breast cancer patients with

AB  - We estimated the impact of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on the risk of
      axillary recurrence (AR) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients with
      micrometastases or isolated tumor cells (ITC) in sentinel nodes. We used the
      Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) database to identify patients with 
      micrometastases or ITC in sentinel nodes following surgery for primary breast
      cancer between 2002 and 2008. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was
      developed to assess the hazard ratios (HR) for AR and OS between patients with
      and without ALND. We identified 2074 patients, of which 240 did not undergo
      further axillary surgery. The 5-year cumulated incidence for AR was 1.58 %. No
      significant difference in AR was seen between patients with and without ALND. The
      age adjusted HR for AR if ALND was omitted was 1.79 (95 % CI 0.41-7.80, P = 0.44)
      in patients with micrometastases and 2.21 (95 % CI 0.54-8.95, P = 0.27), in
      patients with ITC after a median follow-up of 6 years and 3 months. There was no 
      significant difference in overall survival between patients with and without
      ALND, when adjusting for age, co-morbidity, tumor size, histology type,
      malignancy grade, lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor status, adjuvant
      systemic treatment and radiotherapy, with a HR for death if ALND was omitted of
      1.21 (95 % CI 0.86-1.69, P = 0.27) in patients with micrometastases and 0.96 (95 
      % CI 0.57-1.62, P = 0.89) in patients with ITC after a medium follow-up on 8 and 
      5 years. In this nationwide study, we found a low risk of AR on 1.58 % and we did
      not find a significantly increased risk of AR if ALND was omitted in patients
      with micrometastases or ITC in sentinel nodes. Furthermore, no significant
      difference in overall survival was seen between patients with and without ALND
      when adjusting for adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Both high expression of pyruvate kinase M2 and vascular endothelial growth
      factor-C predicts poorer prognosis in human breast cancer.
PG  - 8028-37
AB  - Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) have 
      been known to play an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in
      breast cancer. However, the association between PKM2 and VEGF-C in breast cancer 
      remains unclear. In the present study, a total of 218 specimens from breast
      cancer patients and 26 paired breast tumors with adjacent normal tissues as well 
      as two breast cancer cell lines were enrolled to investigate the correlation
      between PKM2 and VEGF-C. We found that PKM2 and VEGF-C mRNA levels were both
      significantly increasing in breast tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues. 
      Knockdown of PKM2 mRNA expression resulted in VEGF-C mRNA and protein
      down-regulated as well as cell proliferation inhibited. A positive correlation
      between PKM2 and VEGF-C expression was identified by immunohistochemical analyses
      of 218 specimens of patients with breast cancer (P=0.023). PKM2 high expression
      was significantly correlated with histological grade (P=0.030), lymph node stage 
      (P=0.001), besides VEGF-C high expression was significantly associated with
      lymphovascular invasion (P=0.012). While combined high expression of PKM2 and
      VEGF-C was found to be associated with worse histological grade, more lymph node 
      metastasis, more lymphovascular invasion, shorter progression free survival
      (PFS), and poorer overall survival (OS) in human breast cancer. The results of
      the present study suggested that PKM2 expression was correlated with VEGF-C
      expression, and combination of PKM2 and VEGF-C levels had the better prognostic
      significance in predicting the poor outcome of patients with breast cancer.

PG  - 29388-95

AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to assess the ability of
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      (PET/CT) scanning to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast
      cancer, and to investigate whether timing of the scan and trastuzumab treatment
      influence the accuracy of pCR prediction in human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer patients. We treated 81 locally advanced
      breast cancer patients with four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
      HER2-negative breast cancer patients received NAC alone, while HER2-positive
      breast cancer patients received NAC plus trastuzumab. (18)FDG PET/CT scans were
      scheduled at baseline and after the second cycle of NAC. Axillary lymph node
      (ALN) dissection was performed after the last cycle of neoadjuvant therapy.
      Relative changes in standardized uptake values (SUV) between the two PET/CT scans
      (DeltaSUV) in primary tumors and ALN metastases were calculated. There were 75
      patients with 150 PET/CT scans in the final analysis, including 41 HER2-negative 
      and 34 HER2-positive cases. In the HER2-negative group, the DeltaSUV predicted
      overall and ALN pCR; the receiver operating characteristics-areas under curve
      (ROC-AUC) were 0.87 and 0.80 (P = 0.0014 and 0.031, respectively) and the
      negative predictive values were 94% and 89% respectively. However, in the
      HER2-positive group, DeltaSUV could predict neither overall nor ALN pCR; the
      ROC-AUCs were only 0.56 and 0.53, with P = 0.53 and 0.84, respectively. Hence,
      the DeltaSUV after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy could predict pCR in
      HER2-negative patients treated with NAC alone, but not in HER2-positive patients 
      treated with NAC plus trastuzumab.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to highlight the recent advances (in
      the past 12 months) concerning circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating
      tumor DNA (ctDNA) in oncology. RECENT FINDINGS: The value of CTCs as a prognostic
      biomarker is now well validated in breast, colon, and prostate cancer, but no
      trial has yet demonstrated that modifying treatment according to CTCs is superior
      to standard of care. Ongoing trials are addressing the clinical utility of CTCs. 
      Moreover, there is emerging evidence about the potential of CTCs as a tumor
      tissue source to analyze protein and RNA expression, DNA mutations and drug
      sensitivity. ctDNA is a specific biomarker associated with tumor burden, and
      small studies have shown an association with worse outcome; prospective clinical 
      studies on the prognostic and predictive value of ctDNA are needed. ctDNA can be 
      used for tumor molecular profiling, with the potential advantage to encompass the
      spectrum of mutations present in the tumor. SUMMARY: CTCs and ctDNA are promising
      new biomarkers in oncology, with potential clinical applications for monitoring
      and for comprehensive molecular profiling of cancer. For each assay,
      demonstration of analytical and clinical validity, as well as clinical utility in
      prospective clinical trials is needed before implementation in clinical practice.

TI  - Digital Compared with Screen-Film Mammography: Measures of Diagnostic Accuracy
      among Women Screened in the Ontario Breast Screening Program.
PG  - 365-73

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare measures of diagnostic accuracy between large concurrent
      cohorts of women screened with digital computed radiography (CR), direct
      radiography (DR), and screen-film mammography (SFM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      study was approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board; informed
      consent was not required. Three concurrent cohorts of women aged 50-74 years who 
      were screened from 2008-2009 in the Ontario Breast Screening Program with SFM
      (487,334 screening examinations, 403,688 women), DR (254,758 screening
      examinations, 220,520 women), or CR (74,140 screening examinations, 64,210 women)
      were followed for 2 years or until breast cancer diagnosis. Breast cancers were
      classified as screening-detected or interval on the basis of the woman's final
      screening and assessment results. Interval cancer rate (per 10 000 negative
      screening examinations), sensitivity, and specificity were compared across the
      cohorts by using mixed-effects logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Interval
      cancer rates were higher, although not significantly so, for CR (15.2 per 10,000;
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8, 17.8) and were similar for DR (13.7 per
      10,000; 95% CI: 12.4, 15.0) compared with SFM (13.0 per 10,000; 95% CI: 12.1,
      13.9). For CR versus SFM, specificity was similar while sensitivity was
      significantly lower (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.83; P = .001),
      particularly for invasive cancers detected at a rescreening examination, for
      women with breast density of less than 75%, for women with no family history, and
      for postmenopausal women. For DR versus SFM, sensitivity was similar while
      specificity was lower (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.98; P = .01), particularly for 
      rescreening examinations, for women aged 60-74 years, for women with breast
      density of less than 75%, for women with a family history, and for women who were
      postmenopausal. CONCLUSION: Given the 38% lower sensitivity of CR imaging systems
      compared with SFM, programs should assess the continued use of this technology
      for breast screening.

AB  - Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients frequently relapse by 24 months
      and develop resistant disease. Research on EOC therapies relies on cancer cell
      lines established decades ago making Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) attractive 
      models, because they are faithful representations of the original tumor. We
      established 35 ovarian cancer PDXs resulting from the original graft of 77 EOC
      samples onto immuno-compromised mice. PDXs covered the diversity of EOC
      histotypes and graft take was correlated with early patient death. Fourteen PDXs 
      were characterized at the genetic and histological levels. PDXs reproduced
      phenotypic features of the ovarian tumors of origin and conserved the principal
      characteristics of the original copy number change (CNC) profiles over several
      passages. However, CNC fluctuations in specific subregions comparing the original
      tumor and the PDXs indicated the oligoclonal nature of the original tumors.
      Detailed analysis by CGH, FISH and exome sequencing of one case, for which
      several tumor nodules were sampled and grafted, revealed that PDXs globally
      maintained an oligoclonal structure. No overgrowth of a particular subclone
      present in the original tumor was observed in the PDXs. This suggested that
      xenotransplantation of ovarian tumors and growth as PDX preserved at least in
      part the clonal diversity of the original tumor. We believe our data reinforce
      the potential of PDX as exquisite tools in pre-clinical assays.

TI  - Treatment of inferior pole breast cancer with the oncoplastic 'Crescent'
      technique: the Westmead experience.
PG  - 88-91
LID - 10.1111/ans.13268 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conservative treatment of inferior breast cancers has been a
      challenge for breast surgeons due to the high incidence of poor cosmetic
      outcomes. In 2008, Renouvel et al. described an oncoplastic 'Crescent' technique 
      utilizing an advancement flap to fill the defect after cancer excision in the
      lower pole of the breast. A follow-up study demonstrated no local recurrence at
      45 months and excellent or good cosmetic outcomes in over 70% of patients. This
      study aims to assess the outcomes of applying this 'Crescent' technique in a
      breast surgical unit. METHODS: Retrospective study carried out at Westmead Breast
      Cancer Institute on 16 patients treated with the 'Crescent' technique. Data
      regarding patient and tumour characteristics, operative outcomes and
      complications were obtained. Patients were invited to complete a modified
      Breast-Q questionnaire and have their photographs taken to assess patient
      satisfaction and cosmetic outcome. RESULTS: Over 12 months, 16 women underwent
      the 'Crescent' technique. Mean tumour size was 11.4 mm (range 2.0-36 mm) and
      median resected volume was 33.0 g (range 15-117 g). One patient (7.1%) had
      involved margins. One patient returned to theatre for evacuation of a haematoma. 
      Cosmetic outcome was excellent or good in over 80% of patients. CONCLUSION: The
      oncoplastic 'Crescent' technique is a safe and reliable technique with good
      cosmetic outcome that can be implemented in a breast surgical unit.

AB  - Glycosylation and related processes play important roles in cancer development
      and progression, including metastasis. Several studies have shown that N-glycans 
      have potential diagnostic value as cancer serum biomarkers. We have explored the 
      significance of the abundance of particular serum N-glycan structures as
      important features of breast tumour biology by studying the serum glycome and
      tumour transcriptome (mRNA and miRNA) of 104 breast cancer patients. Integration 
      of these types of molecular data allows us to study the relationship between
      serum glycans and transcripts representing functional pathways, such as metabolic
      pathways or DNA damage response. We identified tri antennary trigalactosylated
      trisialylated glycans in serum as being associated with lower levels of tumour
      transcripts involved in focal adhesion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. These
      glycan structures were also linked to poor prognosis in patients with ER negative
      tumours. High abundance of simple monoantennary glycan structures were associated
      with increased survival, particularly in the basal-like subgroup. The presence of
      circulating tumour cells was found to be significantly associated with several
      serum glycome structures like bi and triantennary, di- and trigalactosylated, di-
      and trisialylated. The link between tumour miRNA expression levels and N-glycan
      production is also examined.

TI  - SNP-SNP interaction analysis of NF-kappaB signaling pathway on breast cancer
      survival.
PG  - 37979-94
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.4991 [doi]
AB  - In breast cancer, constitutive activation of NF-kappaB has been reported,
      however, the impact of genetic variation of the pathway on patient prognosis has 
      been little studied. Furthermore, a combination of genetic variants, rather than 
      single polymorphisms, may affect disease prognosis. Here, in an extensive dataset
      (n = 30,431) from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, we investigated the
      association of 917 SNPs in 75 genes in the NF-kappaB pathway with breast cancer
      prognosis. We explored SNP-SNP interactions on survival using the
      likelihood-ratio test comparing multivariate Cox' regression models of SNP pairs 
      without and with an interaction term. We found two interacting pairs associating 
      with prognosis: patients simultaneously homozygous for the rare alleles of
      rs5996080 and rs7973914 had worse survival (HRinteraction 6.98, 95% CI=3.3-14.4, 
      P=1.42E-07), and patients carrying at least one rare allele for rs17243893 and
      rs57890595 had better survival (HRinteraction 0.51, 95% CI=0.3-0.6, P =
      2.19E-05). Based on in silico functional analyses and literature, we speculate
      that the rs5996080 and rs7973914 loci may affect the BAFFR and TNFR1/TNFR3
      receptors and breast cancer survival, possibly by disturbing both the canonical
      and non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways or their dynamics, whereas,
      rs17243893-rs57890595 interaction on survival may be mediated through
      TRAF2-TRAIL-R4 interplay. These results warrant further validation and functional
      analyses.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.4828 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the composition of wound fluid (WF) and investigate the
      impact of WF on breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: The proliferation and
      migration of WF-treated breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were assessed
      with colony formation test, MTT cell proliferation test and scratch wound test.
      The quantitative profiles of WF were analyzed using Bio-Plex Pro kits. RESULTS:
      The proliferation and migration of WF-treated breast cancer cells were
      significantly higher than that of untreated cells. Fifteen cytokines, 29
      chemokines and 9 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were assessed in WF. The
      concentrations of these factors were influenced by post-surgery days, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NAC), TNM stage, pathological type and molecular subtype. The WF
      harvested from patients underwent NAC showed significant higher profiles of
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-4, IL-6, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-23, IL-25, IL-31,
      Interferon gamma (IFNgamma), CD40 ligand (CD40L), tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha), CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL3, CCL7 and CCL20. CONCLUSIONS:
      Surgery-induced WF promotes the proliferation and migration of breast cancer
      cells. The composition of WF is influenced by various clinical features and
      provides potential therapeutic targets to control local recurrence and tumor
      progression.

TI  - Anxa2 binds to STAT3 and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast 
      cancer cells.

AB  - Overexpression of annexin A2 (Anxa2) is correlated with invasion and metastasis
      in breast cancer cells. In this study, breast cancer patients with upregulated
      Anxa2 exhibited poor overall and disease-free survival rates. Anxa2 expression
      was also positively correlated with the expression of epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in breast
      cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of Anxa2 impaired EGF-induced 
      EMT, as well as the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro.
      Meanwhile, Anxa2 depletion significantly ablated pulmonary metastasis in a severe
      combined immunodeficiency mouse model of breast cancer. Importantly, Anxa2
      reduction inhibited EGF-induced activation of STAT3, which is required for
      EGF-induced EMT. Anxa2 directly bound to STAT3 and enhanced its transcriptional
      activity, thereby indicating that Anxa2 promotes EGF-induced EMT in a
      STAT3-dependent manner. Our findings provide clinical evidence that Anxa2 is a
      poor prognostic factor for breast cancer and reveal a novel mechanism through
      which Anxa2 promotes breast cancer metastasis.

TI  - Reproductive factors and hormone receptor status among very young (<35 years)
      breast cancer patients.
PG  - 24571-80
AB  - The prognosis for breast cancer occurs in young women is usually poor. The impact
      of different reproductive factors on disease characteristics is still largely
      unknown. We analyzed 261 patients aged </=35 years old who were treated at the
      Cancer Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. The relationships between
      certain reproductive factors (age at menarche, parity, number of children,
      breastfeeding, history of abortion, age at first full-term pregnancy and oral
      contraceptive (OC) use) and disease characteristics were evaluated. Compared with
      patients who experienced fewer full-term pregnancies (<2 times), the patients
      with more full-term pregnancies (>/=2 times) exhibited higher percentage of
      ER-positive tumors (61.5%) (P = 0.015), and patients whose age of menarche was
      >/=15 years exhibited a greater chance of PR-positive tumors (64.8%) (P = 0.036) 
      compared with those whose age of menarche was <15 years old. Additionally,
      patients who had taken OCs were more likely to present with late-stage tumors (II
      stage or later) (87.5%) (P = 0.002) than patients who had never taken OCs. Our
      study provides evidence that women with more full-term pregnancies and later age 
      at menarche are more possible to exhibit hormone receptor-positive tumors.
      Additionally, patients who have taken OCs are more likely to present with
      advanced disease.

AB  - Detection of minor, genetically distinct subpopulations within tumors is a key
      challenge in cancer genomics. Here we report STAR-FISH (specific-to-allele
      PCR-FISH), a novel method for the combined detection of single-nucleotide and
      copy number alterations in single cells in intact archived tissues. Using this
      method, we assessed the clinical impact of changes in the frequency and topology 
      of PIK3CA mutation and HER2 (ERBB2) amplification within HER2-positive breast
      cancer during neoadjuvant therapy. We found that these two genetic events are not
      always present in the same cells. Chemotherapy selects for PIK3CA-mutant cells, a
      minor subpopulation in nearly all treatment-naive samples, and modulates genetic 
      diversity within tumors. Treatment-associated changes in the spatial distribution
      of cellular genetic diversity correlated with poor long-term outcome following
      adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab. Our findings support the use of in situ single
      cell-based methods in cancer genomics and imply that chemotherapy before
      HER2-targeted therapy may promote treatment resistance.

TI  - Height and Breast Cancer Risk: Evidence From Prospective Studies and Mendelian
      Randomization.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djv219 [doi]
LID - djv219 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have linked adult height with breast cancer
      risk in women. However, the magnitude of the association, particularly by
      subtypes of breast cancer, has not been established. Furthermore, the mechanisms 
      of the association remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to
      investigate associations between height and breast cancer risk using data from
      159 prospective cohorts totaling 5216302 women, including 113178 events. In a
      consortium with individual-level data from 46325 case patients and 42482 control 
      patients, we conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis using a genetic score
      that comprised 168 height-associated variants as an instrument. This association 
      was further evaluated in a second consortium using summary statistics data from
      16003 case patients and 41335 control patients. RESULTS: The pooled relative risk
      of breast cancer was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 1.19) per 10cm 
      increase in height in the meta-analysis of prospective studies. In Mendelian
      randomization analysis, the odds ratio of breast cancer per 10cm increase in
      genetically predicted height was 1.22 (95% CI = 1.13 to 1.32) in the first
      consortium and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.05 to 1.39) in the second consortium. The
      association was found in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women but
      restricted to hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Analyses of
      height-associated variants identified eight new loci associated with breast
      cancer risk after adjusting for multiple comparisons, including three loci at
      1q21.2, DNAJC27, and CCDC91 at genome-wide significance level P < 5x10(-8).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides strong evidence that adult height is a risk
      factor for breast cancer in women and certain genetic factors and biological
      pathways affecting adult height have an important role in the etiology of breast 
      cancer.

TI  - Loss of TIM50 suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast cancer.
PG  - 1279-87
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-3878-0 [doi]
AB  - TIM50 is an essential component of TIM23 complex and involved in protein
      translocating into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, we found that TIM50
      was increased in breast cancer cells by SILAC. However, its biological functions 
      and molecular mechanisms in breast cancer are poorly understood. To gain insight 
      into the functions of TIM50 in breast cancer, we constructed two stably
      transfected cell lines and examined TIM50 expression in tissue samples. Our data 
      showed that TIM50 expression was increased in breast cancer. The stable
      suppression of TIM50 expression through lentivirus-mediated shRNA was shown to
      inhibit the abilities of cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. What is 
      more, depletion of TIM50 could decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, which
      may be associated with cell viability. Taken together, our findings reveal a new 
      role for TIM50 in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis through decreasing 
      mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer cell and suggest that TIM50
      might be a potential target for controlling breast cancer progression.

TI  - Of mice and women: a comparative tissue biology perspective of breast stem cells 
      and differentiation.

AB  - Tissue based research requires a background in human and veterinary pathology,
      developmental biology, anatomy, as well as molecular and cellular biology. This
      type of comparative tissue biology (CTB) expertise is necessary to tackle some of
      the conceptual challenges in human breast stem cell research. It is our opinion
      that the scarcity of CTB expertise contributed to some erroneous interpretations 
      in tissue based research, some of which are reviewed here in the context of
      breast stem cells. In this article we examine the dissimilarities between mouse
      and human mammary tissue and suggest how these may impact stem cell studies. In
      addition, we consider the differences between breast ducts vs. lobules and
      clarify how these affect the interpretation of results in stem cell research.
      Lastly, we introduce a new elaboration of normal epithelial cell types in human
      breast and discuss how this provides a clinically useful basis for breast cancer 
      classification.

TI  - Comparison of the diagnostic workup of women referred at non-blinded or blinded
      double reading in a population-based screening mammography programme in the south
      of the Netherlands.
PG  - 1094-8
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2015.295 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether referred women experience differences in
      diagnostic workup at non-blinded or blinded double reading of screening
      mammograms. METHODS: We included a consecutive series of respectively 42.996 and 
      44.491 screens, double read either in a non-blinded or blinded manner between
      2009 and 2011. This reading strategy was alternated on a monthly basis. RESULTS: 
      The overall ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) rate and stereotactic CNB 
      (SCNB) rate per 1000 screens were higher at blinded than at non-blinded reading
      (7.5 vs 6.0, P=0.008 and 8.1 vs 6.6, P=0.009). Among women with benign workup,
      these rates were higher at blinded reading (2.6 vs 1.4, P<0.001 and 5.9 vs 4.7,
      P=0.013). The benign biopsy rates were higher at blinded double reading
      (P<0.001), whereas the positive predictive value of biopsy did not differ
      (P=0.103). CONCLUSIONS: Blinded double-reading results in higher overall CNB and 
      SCNB rates than non-blinded double reading, as well as a higher benign biopsy
      rate.

TI  - Risk of recurrence estimates with IHC4+C are tolerant of variations in staining
      and scoring: an analytical validity study.
PG  - 128-35
LID - 10.1136/jclinpath-2015-203212 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The IHC4+C score combines assessment of oestrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and Ki67 with clinicopathological parameters to
      identify the risk of distant disease recurrence in patients with breast cancer,
      so, aiding treatment decision-making on adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite low cost
      and wide availability, the reported use of IHC4+C remains limited; one
      explanation for this is the perception that immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based
      methods and assessment of them lack precision, reproducibility and portability.
      We examined the effects of decentralised testing and easily reproducible
      estimate-based scoring methods on IHC4+C scores to determine its suitability for 
      wider adoption. METHODS: Sections from a breast cancer tissue micro-array (TMA)
      were distributed to three centres undertaking diagnostic breast cancer IHC.
      Centres stained sections using their standard procedures, and returned them for
      central assessment. The results were compared with those obtained at IHC4+C's
      originating hospital (Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH)). In parallel, TMA sections
      stained at RMH were scored by a variety of simplified non-counting-based methods.
      The results were compared with those produced using counting. RESULTS: There was 
      a high degree of correlation between individual IHC results produced by external 
      centres and those of RMH (r: 0.797-0.982), and between risk of distant recurrence
      scores derived from them (r: 0.972-0.984). Scoring methods for ER and PgR could
      be adapted to require less precision without significantly affecting correlation 
      with counted results (r: 0.933 and 0.980, respectively), but correlation between 
      estimating and counting for Ki67 was poorer (r: 0.855). CONCLUSIONS: IHC4+C is
      tolerant of variation in staining and scoring methods. Although additional
      confirmatory comparative studies are required, these data support use of IHC4+C
      in clinical practice outside RMH.

AB  - Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and
      ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive
      strategies and management of breast cancer. Sanger sequencing has been the gold
      standard in identifying these mutations. However, 4-28% of inherited BRCA
      mutations may be due to large genomic rearrangements (LGRs), which could be
      missed by using Sanger sequencing alone. Our aim is to evaluate the pick-up rate 
      of LGRs in our cohort. A total of 1,236 clinically high-risk patients with breast
      and/or ovarian cancers were recruited through The Hong Kong Hereditary Breast
      Cancer Family Registry from 2007 to 2014. Full gene sequencing (either Sanger or 
      next generation sequencing) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
      (MLPA) were performed. We identified 120 deleterious BRCA mutations: 57 (4.61%)
      were in BRCA1 and 63 (5.10%) were in BRCA2. LGRs accounted for 6.67% (8 of 120)
      of all BRCA mutations, whereas 8.77 % (5 of 57) were BRCA1 mutations and 4.76% (3
      of 63) were BRCA2 mutations. Through this integrated approach, both small
      nucleotide variations and LGRs could be detected. We suggest that MLPA should be 
      incorporated into the standard practice for genetic testing to avoid
      false-negative results, which would greatly affect the management of these
      high-risk families.

TI  - [Accuracy of MRI for estimating residual tumor size after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in breast cancer with three-dimensional reconstruction technique].
PG  - 280-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of MRI for estimating residual tumor size
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction
      technique. METHODS: This was a prospective study. The data of 61 patients with
      pathologically proven solitary invasive ductal carcinoma (IIA-IIIC) who had
      received 6 to 8 cycles of NAC from July 2010 to August 2013 was analyzed. All the
      patients were female, aging from 31 to 70 years with a median of 49 years. Breast
      specimen after surgery was prepared with part-mount sub-serial section, and
      residual tumors were microscopically outlined, scanned and registered by
      Photoshop software. The 3D model of pathological and MRI residual tumors was
      reconstructed with 3D-DOCTOR software. The longest diameter, maximum
      cross-section area and volume of the residual tumors determined using 3D MRI were
      compared with 3D pathological findings, and the associations between MRI and
      pathology were analyzed by Spearman rank correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.
      RESULTS: The longest diameter, maximum cross-section area and volume of the
      residual tumors after NAC measured by MRI and pathology was highly correlated
      (r=0.942, 0.941, 0.903, all P=0.00). MRI appears to underestimate pathology in
      the longest diameter, maximum cross-section area, but slightly overestimate in
      volume, and two methods had a good consistence (MD=0.3 cm, 95% CI: -1.43 to 1.9
      cm; MD=1.39 cm(2), 95% CI: -9.55 to 12.34 cm(2); MD=-0.433 cm(3), 95% CI: -7.065 
      to 6.199 cm(3)). CONCLUSION: 3D MRI reconstruction after NAC could accurately
      detects the residual tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and contribute to
      select patients who received breast conserving therapy after NAC with tumor
      downstaging.

TI  - Polymorphisms in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) promoter and 3'
      untranslated region and their association with PARP1 expression in breast cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 7059-71
AB  - Within the past several years, inhibition of the PARP1 activity has been emerged 
      as one of the most exciting and promising strategies for triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess PARP1 expression in
      TNBCs and to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in PARP1 promoter or 
      3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and PARP1 expression. It was found that PARP1 was 
      overexpressed in nuclear (nPARP1), cytoplasm (cPARP1) and nuclear-cytoplasmic
      coexisting (coPARP1) of 187 TNBCs in comparison to that of 115 non-TNBCs (nPARP1,
      p<0.001; cPARP1, p<0.001; coPARP1, p<0.001). High expression of nPARP1 and cPARP1
      in breast cancer was related to worse progression-free survival (nPARP1, p=0.007,
      cPARP1, p=0.003). Additionally, we identified seven published polymorphism sites 
      in the promoter region and in 3'UTR of PARP1 by sequencing. rs7527192 and
      rs2077197 genotypes were found to be significantly associated with the cPARP1
      expression in TNBC patients (rs7527192 AA+GA versus GG, p=0.014; rs2077197 AA+GA 
      versus GG, p=0.041). These findings were confirmed in an independent validation
      set of 88 TNBCs (rs7527192 GG versus GA+AA, p=0.030; rs2077197 GG versus GA+AA,
      p=0.030). The PARP1 over-expression including nuclear, cytoplasm and
      nuclear-cytoplasmic coexisting is a feature of TNBCs and the assessment of its
      expression may help to predict the efficacy of chemotherapy with PARP1 inhibitor.

AB  - The objective of the study was to investigate whether specific single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) with influence on drug transport, biotransformation and
      repair mechanisms are associated with treatment outcome and toxicity in
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We genotyped blood samples from 519 mCRC
      patients treated with first-line 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin +/- cetuximab for
      17 SNPs in 10 genes involved in membrane transport (ABCC1 and ABCC2), drug
      biotransformation (GSTP1 and AGXT) and DNA repair (ERCC1, ERCC2, XRCC1, XRCC3,
      XPG and MSH6). The AGXT-rs34116584 and the ERCC2-rs238406 polymorphisms were
      significantly associated with progression-free survival (P=0.002 and P=0.001,
      respectively). Associations between 18 toxicity variables and SNPs were
      identified, although none were significant after Bonferroni correction for
      multiple comparisons. The study identified SNPs of potential use as markers of
      clinical outcome in oxaliplatin-treated mCRC patients. If validated in other
      studies, they could improve the selection of therapy in mCRC.

TI  - Risk of contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: a
      30-year semi-prospective analysis.
PG  - 531-8
LID - 10.1007/s10689-015-9825-9 [doi]
AB  - BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of contralateral breast 
      cancer after primary breast cancer. Risk reduction strategies are discussed after
      assessment of risk factors for developing contralateral breast cancer. We
      assessed potential risk factors that could be of use in clinical practice,
      including the novel use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) testing. 506
      BRCA1 and 505 BRCA2 mutation carriers with a diagnosis of breast cancer were
      observed for up to 30 years. The risk of a contralateral breast cancer is
      approximately 2-3% per year, remaining constant for at least 20 years. This was
      similar in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Initial breast cancer before age
      40-years was a significant risk factor, which was more pronounced in BRCA1
      patients. The effect of risk-reducing oophorectomy on contralateral breast cancer
      risk may be overestimated because of bias. No significant association was found
      between overall breast cancer risk SNP score and contralateral breast cancer
      development. Young mutation carriers, particularly those with BRCA1 mutations,
      who develop breast cancer have a significantly higher risk of developing
      contralateral breast cancer, remaining constant for over 20 years. Contralateral 
      risk-reducing mastectomy should be considered in this group, in particular as
      there is a survival benefit. Caution is advised when counselling women
      considering risk-reducing oophorectomy as, after accounting for statistical bias,
      the associated risk reduction was found to be non-significant, and potentially
      smaller than has been previously reported. SNP testing did not add any further
      discriminatory information when assessing contralateral breast cancer risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in popliteal basins are rare, and there is
      controversy in literature regarding their origin, management, and outcomes.
      OBJECTIVES: To correlate clinical and pathological features of popliteal basin
      drainage and analyze the impact of popliteal lymph node drainage on survival.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of SLN biopsies performed at a
      single institution between 2000 and 2010. RESULTS: SLN biopsies were performed in
      254 patients with melanoma in lower limbs, 247 of which were evaluated. In this
      group, there were 59 patients (24%) with a positive SLN. Twenty-seven cases (11%)
      presented with popliteal drainage, one of which lacked concurrent groin drainage.
      Among these 27 patients, three (11%) had popliteal metastasis, one of which had
      exclusive involvement of this basin. Popliteal drainage was associated with worse
      5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.028) but not 5-year overall survival
      (OS) (P = 0.219) in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, Breslow
      thickness, mitotic index, and positive SLN were prognostic factors for DFS. Only 
      mitotic index correlated significantly with OS (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS:
      Popliteal drainage seems to be associated with worse prognostic features of the
      primary tumor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate the balance between the innate
      and adaptive immune responses. Missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
      TLRs might be functional and thus influence the risks of chronic infection and
      cancer development. Here, we investigated the association of two missense SNPs,
      rs3775291 (c.1234G>A) in the TLR3 gene and rs4833095 (c.743T>C) in the TLR1 gene,
      with relapse-free survival (RFS) in a cohort of prospectively observed breast
      cancer patients. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, rs3775291 in
      TLR3 and rs4833095 in TLR1 were genotyped in 715 patients with primary breast
      cancer in a Chinese population. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that the
      patients with the AA genotype of rs3775291 had a shorter RFS compared with those 
      carrying the G allele in the recessive model (P<0.01), but this finding was not
      observed with the dominant model (P = 0.31). The results remained significant
      after adjusting for the clinical parameters in the recessive model (HR = 3.53,
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.98-6.31, P<0.01). Further survival analysis
      indicated that this SNP was significant in the luminal-B, triple-negative breast 
      cancer (TNBC), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+)
      patients using the recessive model but that it was not significant in the
      luminal-A patients. The SNP rs4833095 showed a non-significant tendency toward an
      increased RFS rate in the patients with the TT genotype. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      suggest that the SNP rs3775291 in TLR3 may influence patient outcome. Further
      studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to validate our findings.

TI  - SIRT1 is involved in oncogenic signaling mediated by GPER in breast cancer.
PG  - e1834
LID - 10.1038/cddis.2015.201 [doi]
AB  - A number of tumors exhibit an altered expression of sirtuins, including
      NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) that
      may act as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter mainly depending on the tumor
      types. For instance, in breast cancer cells SIRT1 was shown to exert an essential
      role toward the oncogenic signaling mediated by the estrogen receptor-alpha
      (ERalpha). In accordance with these findings, the suppression of SIRT1 led to the
      inhibition of the transduction pathway triggered by ERalpha. As the regulation of
      SIRT1 has not been investigated in cancer cells lacking ER, in the present study 
      we ascertained the expression and function of SIRT1 by estrogens in ER-negative
      breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts obtained from breast cancer
      patients. Our results show that 17beta-estradiol (E2) and the selective ligand of
      GPER, namely G-1, induce the expression of SIRT1 through GPER and the subsequent 
      activation of the EGFR/ERK/c-fos/AP-1 transduction pathway. Moreover, we
      demonstrate that SIRT1 is involved in the pro-survival effects elicited by E2
      through GPER, like the prevention of cell cycle arrest and cell death induced by 
      the DNA damaging agent etoposide. Interestingly, the aforementioned actions of
      estrogens were abolished silencing GPER or SIRT1, as well as using the SIRT1
      inhibitor Sirtinol. In addition, we provide evidence regarding the involvement of
      SIRT1 in tumor growth stimulated by GPER ligands in breast cancer cells and
      xenograft models. Altogether, our data suggest that SIRT1 may be included in the 
      transduction network activated by estrogens through GPER toward the breast cancer
      progression.

TI  - Relative Effectiveness of Letrozole Compared With Tamoxifen for Patients With
      Lobular Carcinoma in the BIG 1-98 Trial.
PG  - 2772-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2015.60.8133 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of letrozole compared with
      tamoxifen for patients with invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Patients diagnosed with early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) or
      classic invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) who were randomly assigned onto the
      Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial and who had centrally reviewed
      pathology data were included (N = 2,923). HER2-negative IDC and ILC were
      additionally classified as hormone receptor-positive with high (luminal B [LB]
      -like) or low (luminal A [LA] -like) proliferative activity by Ki-67 labeling
      index. Survival analyses were performed with weighted Cox models that used
      inverse probability of censoring weighted modeling. RESULTS: The median follow-up
      time was 8.1 years. In multivariable models for disease-free survival (DFS),
      significant interactions between treatment and histology (ILC or IDC; P = .006)
      and treatment and subgroup (LB like or LA like; P = .01) were observed. In the
      ILC subset, there was a 66% reduction in the hazard of a DFS event with letrozole
      for LB (hazard ratio [HR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.55) and a 50% reduction for LA
      subtypes (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.78). In the IDC subset, there was a
      significant 35% reduction in the hazard of a DFS event with letrozole for the LB 
      subtype (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79), but no difference between treatments
      was noted for IDC and the LA subtype (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20).
      CONCLUSION: The magnitude of benefit of adjuvant letrozole is greater for
      patients diagnosed with lobular carcinoma versus ductal carcinoma.

      multidrug resistance of basal-like breast cancer.

AB  - Forkhead box (FOX) F2 and FOXC2 belong to the FOX transcription factor
      superfamily. FOXC2 is recognized as an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT), and its overexpression promotes basal-like breast cancer (BLBC)
      metastasis. Our previous study demonstrated that FOXF2 functions as an EMT
      suppressor and that FOXF2 deficiency promotes BLBC metastasis. However, the
      relationship between the opposite EMT-related transcription factors FOXF2 and
      FOXC2 remains unknown. Here, we found that FOXF2 directly targets FOXC2 to
      negatively regulate FOXC2 transcription in BLBC cells. Functionally, we observed 
      that FOXC2 mediates the FOXF2-regulated EMT phenotype, aggressive behavior, and
      multiple chemotherapy drug resistance of BLBC cells. Additionally, we detected a 
      significant negative correlation between the FOXF2 and FOXC2 mRNA levels in
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues. TNBC patients in the
      FOXF2high/FOXC2low and FOXF2low/FOXC2high groups exhibited the best and worst
      disease-free survival (DFS), respectively, whereas the patients in the
      FOXF2high/FOXC2high and FOXF2low/FOXC2low groups exhibited moderate DFS. In
      summary, we found that FOXF2 transcriptionally targets FOXC2 and suppresses EMT
      and multidrug resistance by negatively regulating the transcription of FOXC2 in
      BLBC cells. The combined expression levels of FOXF2 and FOXC2 mRNA might serve as
      an effective prognostic indicator and could guide tailored therapy for TNBC or
      BLBC patients.

TI  - Elevated C1orf63 expression is correlated with CDK10 and predicts better outcome 
      for advanced breast cancers: a retrospective study.
PG  - 548
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1569-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chromosome 1 open reading frame 63 (C1orf63) is located on the distal
      short arm of chromosome 1, whose allelic loss has been observed in several human 
      cancers. C1orf63 has been reported to be up-regulated in IL-2-starved T
      lymphocytes, which suggests it might be involved in cell cycle control, a common 
      mechanism for carcinogenesis. Here we investigated the expression and clinical
      implication of C1orf63 in breast cancer. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded specimens,
      clinicopathological features and follow-up data of the breast cancer patients
      were collected. Publicly available microarray and RNA-seq datasets used in this
      study were downloaded from ArrayExpress of EBI and GEO of NCBI. KM plotter tool
      was also adopted. The expression of C1orf63 and CDK10, one known cell
      cycle-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, was assessed by
      immunohistochemistry. Western blotting was performed to detect C1orf63 protein in
      human breast cancer cell lines, purchased from the Culture Collection of the
      Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai. RESULTS: In a group of 12 human breast
      tumors and their matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues, C1orf63 expression was
      observed in 7 of the 12 breast tumors, but not in the 12 adjacent non-cancerous
      tissues (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed of C1orf63 mRNA expression
      both in breast cancer and several other cancers, including lung cancer, prostate 
      cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In another group of 182 breast cancer
      patients, C1orf63 expression in tumors was not correlated with any
      clinicopathological features collected in this study. Survival analyses showed
      that there was no significant difference of overall survival (OS) rates between
      the C1orf63 (+) group and the C1orf63 (-) group (P = 0.145). However, the
      analyses of KM plotter displayed a valid relationship between C1orf63 and RFS
      (relapse free survival)/OS (P < 0.001; P = 0.007). Notablely, in breast cancers
      with advanced TNM stages (III ~ IV) among these 182 patients, C1orf63 expression 
      was an independent prognostic factor predicting better clinical outcome (HR:
      0.41; 95 % CI: 0.17 ~ 0.97; P = 0.042). Additionally, we found that CDK10 mRNA
      expression was positively correlated with C1orf63, which was consistent with the 
      relationship of protein expression between C1orf63 and CDK10 (r s = 0.391; P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, C1orf63
      expression was elevated in tumor tissues. However, C1orf63 predicts better
      prognosis for breast cancers with advanced TNM stage, and the underlying
      mechanism is unknown. In addition, C1orf63 is correlated with the cell cycle
      related gene, CDK10.

      prevention. METHODS: Data of 3584 women attending screening from a
      population-based multicenter cross-sectional study (DDM-Spain) collected from
      October 7, 2007 through July 14, 2008, was used to calculate a score that
      measures the level of compliance with the WCRF/AICR recommendations: R1)Maintain 
      adequate body weight; R2)Be physically active; 3R)Limit the intake of high
      density foods; R4)Eat mostly plant foods; R5)Limit the intake of animal foods;
      R6)Limit alcohol intake; R7)Limit salt and salt preserved food intake; R8)Meet
      nutritional needs through diet. The association between the score and MD
      (assessed by a single radiologist using a semi-quantitative scale) was evaluated 
      using ordinal logistic models with random center-specific intercepts adjusted for
      the main determinants of MD. Stratified analyses by menopausal status and smoking
      status were also carried out. RESULTS: A higher compliance with the WCRF/AICR
      recommendations was associated with lower MD (OR1-unit increase = 0.93
      95%CI:0.86;0.99). The association was stronger in postmenopausal women (OR = 0.91
      95%CI:0.84;0.99) and nonsmokers (OR = 0.87;95%CI:0.80;0.96 for nonsmokers, OR =
      1.01 95%CI:0.91;1.12 for smokers, P-interaction = 0.042). Among nonsmokers,
      maintaining adequate body weight (OR = 0.81 95%CI:0.65;1.01), practicing physical
      activity (OR = 0.68 95%CI:0.48;0.96) and moderating the intake of high-density
      foods (OR = 0.58 95%CI:0.40;0.86) and alcoholic beverages (OR = 0.76
      95%CI:0.55;1.05) were the recommendations showing the strongest associations with
      MD. CONCLUSIONS: postmenopausal women and non-smokers with greater compliance
      with the WCRF/AICR guidelines have lower MD. These results may provide guidance
      to design specific recommendations for screening attendants with high MD and
      therefore at higher risk of developing BC.

TI  - Digital imaging in the immunohistochemical evaluation of the proliferation
      markers Ki67, MCM2 and Geminin, in early breast cancer, and their putative
      prognostic value.
PG  - 546
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1531-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation may provide
      additional prognostic information in early breast cancer. However, due to a lack 
      of methodological standards proliferation markers are still not routinely used
      for determining therapy. Even for Ki67, one of the most widely-studied markers,
      disagreements over the optimal cutoff exist. Improvements in digital microscopy
      may provide new avenues to standardise and make data more reproducible. METHODS: 
      We studied the immunohistochemical expression of three markers of proliferation: 
      Ki67, Mini-Chromosome Maintenance protein 2 and Geminin, by conventional light
      microscope and digital imaging on triplicate TMAs from 309 consecutive cases of
      primary breast cancers. Differences between the average and the maximum
      percentage reactivity in tumour cell nuclei from the three TMA cores were
      investigated to assess the validity of the approach. Time-dependent Receiver
      Operating Characteristic curves were utilized to obtain optimal expression level 
      cut-offs, which were then correlated with clinico-pathological features and
      survival. RESULTS: High concordance between conventional and digital scores was
      observed for all 3 markers (Ki67: rs = 0.87, P < 0.001; MCM2: rs = 0.94, P <
      0.001; and Geminin: rs = 0.86, P < 0.001; Spearman's rank). There was no
      significant difference according to the number of TMA cores included for either
      Ki67 or MCM2; analysis of two or three cores produced comparable results. Higher 
      levels of all three proliferation markers were significantly associated with
      higher grade (P < 0.001) and ER-negativity (P < 0.001). Optimal prognostic
      cut-offs for percentage expression in the tumour were 8 %, 12 and 2.33 % for
      Ki67, MCM2 and Geminin respectively. All 3 proliferation marker cutoffs were
      predictive of 15-year breast cancer-specific survival in univariable Cox
      regression analyses. In multivariable analysis only lymph node status (HR = 3.9, 
      95 % CI = 1.79-8.5, P = 0.0006) and histological grade (HR = 1.84, 95 % CI =
      1-3.38, P = 0.05) remained significantly prognostic. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show
      that. MCM2 is a more sensitive marker of proliferation than Ki67 and should be
      examined in future studies, especially in the lymph node-negative, hormone
      receptor-positive subgroup. Further, digital microscopy can be used effectively
      as a high-throughput method to evaluate immunohistochemical expression.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Disparity in Symptomatic Breast Cancer Awareness despite a
      Recent Screen: The Role of Tumor Biology and Mammography Facility
      Characteristics.
PG  - 1599-606
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a racially and ethnically diverse sample of recently diagnosed
      urban patients with breast cancer, we examined associations of patient, tumor
      biology, and mammography facility characteristics on the probability of
      symptomatic discovery of their breast cancer despite a recent prior screening
      mammogram. METHODS: In the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago study, self-reports at
      interview were used to define patients as having a screen-detected breast cancer 
      or having symptomatic awareness despite a recent screening mammogram (SADRS), in 
      the past 1 or 2 years. Patients with symptomatic breast cancer who did not report
      a recent prior screen were excluded from these analyses. Characteristics
      associated with more aggressive disease [estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone
      receptor (PR)-negative status and higher tumor grade] were abstracted from
      medical records. Mammogram facility characteristics that might indicate aspects
      of screening quality were defined and controlled for in some analyses. RESULTS:
      SADRS was more common among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic than among
      non-Hispanic white patients (36% and 42% vs. 25%, respectively, P = 0.0004).
      SADRS was associated with ER/PR-negative and higher-grade disease. Patients
      screened at sites that relied on dedicated radiologists and sites that were
      breast imaging centers of excellence were less likely to report SADRS. Tumor and 
      facility factors together accounted for two thirds of the disparity in SADRS
      (proportion mediated = 70%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Facility resources and tumor
      aggressiveness explain much of the racial/ethnic disparity in symptomatic breast 
      cancer among recently screened patients. IMPACT: A more equitable distribution of
      high-quality screening would ameliorate but not eliminate this disparity.

TI  - Expression of an estrogen-regulated variant transcript of the peroxisomal
      branched chain fatty acid oxidase ACOX2 in breast carcinomas.
PG  - 524
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1510-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alternate transcripts from a single gene locus greatly enhance the
      combinatorial flexibility of the human transcriptome. Different patterns of exon 
      usage have been observed when comparing normal tissue to cancers, suggesting that
      variant transcripts may play a role in the tumor phenotype. METHODS: Ribonucleic 
      acid-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from breast cancer samples was used to identify an
      intronic start variant transcript of Acyl-CoA oxidase 2, ACOX2 (ACOX2-i9).
      Difference in expression between Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive and ER negative 
      patients was assessed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the findings validated
      in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset (BRCA). ACOX2-i9
      expression was also assessed in cell lines using both quantitative reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis.
      Knock down by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and colony formation assays were used to 
      determine whether ACOX2-i9 expression would influence cellular fitness. The
      effect of ACOX2-i9 expression on patient survival was assessed by the
      Kaplan-Meier survival function, and association to clinical parameters was
      analyzed using a Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The expression and translation of
      ACOX2-i9 into a 25 kDa protein was demonstrated in HepG2 cells as well as in
      several breast cancer cell lines. shRNA knock down of the ACOX2-i9 variant
      resulted in decreased cell viability of T47D and MDA-MB 436 cells. Moreover,
      expression of ACOX2-i9 was shown to be estrogen regulated, being induced by
      propyl pyrazoletriol and inhibited by tamoxifen and fulvestrant in ER+ T47D and
      Mcf-7 cells, but not in the ER- MDA-MB 436 cell line. This variant transcript
      showed expression predominantly in ER-positive breast tumors as assessed in our
      initial set of 53 breast cancers and further validated in 87 tumor/normal pairs
      from the TCGA breast cancer dataset, and expression was associated with better
      outcome in ER positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: ACOX2-i9 is specifically enriched
      in ER+ breast cancers where expression of the variant is associated with improved
      outcome. These data identify variant ACOX2 as a potential novel therapeutic
      biomarker in ER+ breast tumors.

TI  - Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes and Associations With Pathological Complete
      Response and Event-Free Survival in HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer
      Treated With Lapatinib and Trastuzumab: A Secondary Analysis of the NeoALTTO
      Trial.
PG  - 448-54
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0830 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is associated
      with improved outcomes in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive early breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab and
      chemotherapy. The prognostic associations in the neoadjuvant setting of other
      anti-HER2 agents and combinations are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine
      associations between presence of TILs, pathological complete response (pCR), and 
      event-free survival (EFS) end points in patients with early breast cancer treated
      with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or the combination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
      PARTICIPANTS: The NeoALTTO trial (Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab
      Treatment Optimization) randomly assigned 455 women with HER2-positive
      early-stage breast cancer between January 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010, to 1 of 3
      neoadjuvant treatment arms: trastuzumab, lapatinib, or the combination for 6
      weeks followed by the addition of weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks, followed by 3
      cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide after surgery. The
      primary end point used in this study was pCR in the breast and lymph nodes, with 
      a secondary end point of EFS. We evaluated levels of percentage of TILs using
      hematoxylin-eosin-stained core biopsy sections taken at diagnosis (prior to
      treatment) in a prospectively defined retrospective analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURES: Levels of TILs were examined for their associations with efficacy end
      points adjusted for prognostic clinicopathological factors including PIK3CA
      genotype. RESULTS: Of the 455 patients, 387 (85.1%) tumor samples were used for
      the present analysis. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) level of TILs was
      12.5% (5.0%-30.0%), with levels lower in hormone receptor-positive (10.0%
      [5.0%-22.5%]) vs hormone receptor-negative (12.5% [3.0%-35.0%]) samples (P =
      .02). For the pCR end point, levels of TILs greater than 5% were associated with 
      higher pCR rates independent of treatment group (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95%
      CI, 1.26-5.39]; P = .01). With a median (IQR) follow-up time of 3.77 (3.50-4.22) 
      years, every 1% increase in TILs was associated with a 3% decrease in the rate of
      an event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99]; P = .002) across all
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The presence of TILs at diagnosis is
      an independent, positive, prognostic marker in HER2-positive early breast cancer 
      treated with neoadjuvant anti-HER2 agents and chemotherapy for both pCR and EFS
      end points. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00553358.

TI  - HOXB7 Is an ERalpha Cofactor in the Activation of HER2 and Multiple ER Target
      Genes Leading to Endocrine Resistance.
PG  - 944-59
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-15-0090 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Why breast cancers become resistant to tamoxifen despite continued
      expression of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and what factors are
      responsible for high HER2 expression in these tumors remains an enigma. HOXB7
      chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by validation showed that HOXB7
      physically interacts with ERalpha, and that the HOXB7-ERalpha complex enhances
      transcription of many ERalpha target genes, including HER2. Investigating
      strategies for controlling HOXB7, our studies revealed that MYC, stabilized via
      phosphorylation mediated by EGFR-HER2 signaling, inhibits transcription of
      miR-196a, a HOXB7 repressor. This leads to increased expression of HOXB7, ER
      target genes, and HER2. Repressing MYC using small-molecule inhibitors reverses
      these events and causes regression of breast cancer xenografts. The
      MYC-HOXB7-HER2 signaling pathway is eminently targetable in endocrine-resistant
      breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: HOXB7 acts as an ERalpha cofactor regulating a
      myriad of ER target genes, including HER2, in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. 
      HOXB7 expression is controlled by MYC via transcriptional regulation of the HOXB7
      repressor miR-196a; consequently, antagonists of MYC cause reversal of selective 
      ER modulator resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - The Influence of Repeat Surgery and Residual Disease on Recurrence After
      Breast-Conserving Surgery: A Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Study.
PG  - S476-85
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4707-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of women who have breast-conserving surgery 
      (BCS) subsequently undergo re-excision or proceed to mastectomy. This study aimed
      to identify factors associated with residual disease after repeat surgery and to 
      determine their effect on ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and
      survival. METHODS: The study cohort was identified within the national
      population-based registry of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group,
      including women who underwent BCS for unilateral invasive breast cancer between
      2000 and 2009. RESULTS: The study investigated 12,656 women. Within 2 months
      after initial BCS, 1342 (11 %) of these women had a re-excision, and 756 (6 %) of
      the women had a mastectomy. Residual disease was found in 20 % of re-excisions
      and 59 % of mastectomies. In adjusted analysis, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      outside the invasive tumor, positive initial margin, and age younger than 50
      years were associated with increased risk of residual disease. In the adjusted
      analysis, patients with residual disease after re-excision had an increased risk 
      of IBTR regardless whether residual findings were invasive carcinoma [hazard
      ratio (HR), 2.97; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.57-5.62] or DCIS (HR, 2.58; 95 
      % CI 1.50-4.45). However, no difference was seen in overall survival comparing
      patients receiving one excision with those having repeat surgery with or without 
      residual disease (p = 0.96). CONCLUSION: A higher risk of IBTR seen after
      re-excision was associated with residual disease. Overall survival was similar
      regardless of repeat surgery and residual findings.

TI  - Navigating the Challenges of Endocrine Treatments in Premenopausal Women with
      ER-Positive Early Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1311-21
LID - 10.1007/s40265-015-0433-7 [doi]
AB  - Endocrine therapy is a key component of adjuvant treatment for premenopausal
      patients with endocrine-responsive tumors. It is commonly well tolerated,
      although side effects are a main concern in the selection of treatment options.
      Tamoxifen is still considered an adequate endocrine therapy in a large group of
      premenopausal patients (e.g. lower-risk patient, presence of co-morbidities,
      patient preference). Results of the SOFT and TEXT trials addressing new adjuvant 
      endocrine treatment options in premenopausal patients were recently presented.
      Overall, in the SOFT study the premenopausal population did not benefit from the 
      addition of ovarian function suppression (OFS). Nevertheless, for women at
      sufficient risk of recurrence to receive adjuvant chemotherapy and who maintained
      premenopausal estradiol, the addition of OFS to tamoxifen reduced the risk of
      recurrence. The magnitude of the effect was larger in younger patients. Moreover,
      in the SOFT and TEXT trials, adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus OFS, as
      compared with tamoxifen plus OFS, significantly improved disease-free survival,
      breast cancer-free interval and distant disease-free survival. However,
      premenopausal patients include heterogeneous subsets of women and tumors where
      costs and benefits of adjuvant endocrine therapy should be properly weighted.
      Issues specific for premenopausal patients, related to desire for pregnancy,
      family planning, safety, quality of life and subjective side effects, should be a
      priority in the therapeutic algorithm. Therefore, selecting the best-tolerated
      agent can enhance adherence to therapies and reduce the impact on quality of life
      and health status for these younger patients.

TI  - Aberrant DNA methylation impacts gene expression and prognosis in breast cancer
      subtypes.
PG  - 87-97
LID - 10.1002/ijc.29684 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation has a substantial impact on gene expression, affecting the
      prognosis of breast cancer (BC) patients dependent on molecular subtypes. In this
      study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of the expression of genes
      reported as aberrantly methylated, and the link between gene expression and DNA
      methylation in BC subtypes. The prognostic value of the expression of 144
      aberrantly methylated genes was evaluated in ER+/HER2-, HER2+, and ER-/HER2-
      molecular BC subtypes, in a meta-analysis of two large transcriptomic cohorts of 
      BC patients (n = 1,938 and n = 1,640). The correlation between gene expression
      and DNA methylation in distinct gene regions was also investigated in an
      independent dataset of 104 BCs. Survival and Pearson correlation analyses were
      computed for each gene separately. The expression of 48 genes was significantly
      associated with BC prognosis (p < 0.05), and 32 of these prognostic genes
      exhibited a direct expression-methylation correlation. The expression of several 
      immune-related genes, including CD3D and HLA-A, was associated with both
      relapse-free survival (HR = 0.42, p = 3.5E-06; HR = 0.35, p = 1.7E-08) and
      overall survival (HR = 0.50, p = 5.5E-04; HR = 0.68, p = 4.5E-02) in ER-/HER2-
      BCs. On the overall, the distribution of both positive and negative
      expression-methylation correlation in distinct gene regions have different
      effects on gene expression and prognosis in BC subtypes. This large-scale
      meta-analysis allowed the identification of several genes consistently associated
      with prognosis, whose DNA methylation could represent a promising biomarker for
      prognostication and clinical stratification of patients with distinct BC
      subtypes.

TI  - Combined Immunohistochemistry of PLK1, p21, and p53 for Predicting TP53 Status:
      An Independent Prognostic Factor of Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1026-34
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000386 [doi]
AB  - It is difficult to predict the TP53 status by p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC). We 
      aimed to improve the accuracy of p53 IHC with p53-regulated proteins for
      predicting the TP53 mutation status. TP53 mutations were detected in 19 of 38
      breast cancer patients (50%). Five of 7 cases of protein-truncating mutation of
      TP53 were completely negative for p53 IHC, whereas 11 of 12 cases of TP53 point
      mutation were strongly positive for p53 IHC. Therefore, to avoid false negatives,
      we extracted p53-dependent universally downregulated genes using microarray
      analysis from 38 breast cancer patients and 2 p53-inducible cell lines. From 9
      commonly repressed genes, we evaluated 3 genes, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing
      5 (BIRC5), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint
      serine/threonine kinase (BUB1), which were previously identified as p53-dependent
      repressed genes. PLK1>/=Allred total score (TS) 5 showed the highest correlation 
      with TP53 mutation. To decrease false positivity, we evaluated p21 IHC. Although 
      strong staining of p21 was observed in 4 cases (10.5%), all 4 were wild-type
      TP53. Thus, p53 mutation-like (p53mt-like) IHC was identified by p53 TS7,8 with
      PLK1>/=TS 5 and p21 TS</=6. p53 mt-like IHC correlated with TP53 mutation
      (predictive value=0.94). In other 157 breast cancer cases, p53 mt-like was an
      independent prognostic marker in multivariate analysis and a strong prognostic
      factor. Stratification with p53 mt-like IHC identified patients with a poorer
      prognosis. In conclusion, we identified reliable IHC conditions to predict the
      TP53 status of breast cancer patients.

TI  - Mammographic density and breast cancer in women from high risk families.
PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/s13058-015-0604-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mammographic density (MD) is one of the strongest determinants of
      sporadic breast cancer (BC). In this study, we compared MD in BRCA1/2 mutation
      carriers and non-carriers from BRCA1/2 mutation-positive families and
      investigated the association between MD and BC among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers
      per type of mutation and tumor subtype. METHODS: The study was carried out in
      1039 female members of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-positive families followed at 16 
      Spanish Genetic Counseling Units. Participants' density was scored
      retrospectively from available mammograms by a single blinded radiologist using a
      5-category scale (<10 %, 10-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 %, >75 %). In BC cases, we
      selected mammograms taken prior to diagnosis or from the contralateral breast,
      whereas, in non-cases, the last screening mammogram was evaluated. MD
      distribution in carriers and non-carriers was compared using ordinal logistic
      models, and the association between MD and BC in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was
      studied using logistic regression. Huber-White robust estimators of variance were
      used to take into account correlations between family members. A similar
      multinomial model was used to explore this association by BC subtype. RESULTS: We
      identified and scored mammograms from 341 BRCA1, 350 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 
      229 non-carriers. Compared to non-carriers, MD was significantly lower among
      BRCA2 mutation carriers (odds ratio (OR) =0.71; P-value=0.04), but not among
      BRCA1 carriers (OR=0.84; P-value=0.33). MD was associated with subsequent
      development BC (OR per category of MD=1.45; 95 % confidence interval=1.18-1.78,
      P-value<0.001), with no significant differences between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
      carriers (P-value=0.48). Finally, no statistically significant differences were
      observed in the association of MD with specific BC subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study, the largest to date on this issue, confirms that MD is an independent risk
      factor for all BC subtypes in either BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and
      should be considered a phenotype risk marker in this context.

TI  - Can the breast screening appointment be used to provide risk assessment and
      prevention advice?
PG  - 84
LID - 10.1186/s13058-015-0595-y [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer risk is continuing to increase across all societies with rates in
      countries with traditionally lower risks catching up with the higher rates in the
      Western world. Although cure rates from breast cancer have continued to improve
      such that absolute numbers of breast cancer deaths have dropped in many countries
      despite rising incidence, only some of this can be ascribed to screening with
      mammography, and debates over the true value of population-based screening
      continue. As such, enthusiasm for risk-stratified screening is gaining momentum. 
      Guidelines in a number of countries already suggest more frequent screening in
      certain higher-risk (particularly, familial) groups, but this could be extended
      to assessing risks across the population. A number of studies have assessed
      breast cancer risk by using risk algorithms such as the Gail model, Tyrer-Cuzick,
      and BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier
      Estimation Algorithm), but the real questions are when and where such an
      assessment should take place. Emerging evidence from the PROCAS (Predicting Risk 
      Of Cancer At Screening) study is showing not only that it is feasible to
      undertake risk assessment at the population screening appointment but that this
      assessment could allow reduction of screening in lower-risk groups in many
      countries to 3-yearly screening by using mammographic density-adjusted breast
      cancer risk.

TI  - eZinCh-2: A Versatile, Genetically Encoded FRET Sensor for Cytosolic and
      Intraorganelle Zn(2+) Imaging.
PG  - 2126-34
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.5b00211 [doi]
AB  - Zn(2+) plays essential and diverse roles in numerous cellular processes. To get a
      better understanding of intracellular Zn(2+) homeostasis and the putative
      signaling role of Zn(2+), various fluorescent sensors have been developed that
      allow monitoring of Zn(2+) concentrations in single living cells in real time.
      Thus far, two families of genetically encoded FRET-based Zn(2+) sensors have been
      most widely applied, the eCALWY sensors developed by our group and the ZapCY
      sensors developed by Palmer and co-workers. Both have been successfully used to
      measure cytosolic free Zn(2+), but distinctly different concentrations have been 
      reported when using these sensors to measure Zn(2+) concentrations in the ER and 
      mitochondria. Here, we report the development of a versatile alternative FRET
      sensor containing a de novo Cys2His2 binding pocket that was created on the
      surface of the donor and acceptor fluorescent domains. This eZinCh-2 sensor binds
      Zn(2+) with a high affinity that is similar to that of eCALWY-4 (Kd = 1 nM at pH 
      7.1), while displaying a substantially larger change in emission ratio. eZinCh-2 
      not only provides an attractive alternative for measuring Zn(2+) in the cytosol
      but was also successfully used for measuring Zn(2+) in the ER, mitochondria, and 
      secretory vesicles. Moreover, organelle-targeted eZinCh-2 can also be used in
      combination with the previously reported redCALWY sensors to allow multicolor
      imaging of intracellular Zn(2+) simultaneously in the cytosol and the ER or
      mitochondria.

TI  - ALDH2(E487K) mutation increases protein turnover and promotes murine
      hepatocarcinogenesis.
PG  - 9088-93
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1510757112 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in the liver removes toxic
      aldehydes including acetaldehyde, an intermediate of ethanol metabolism. Nearly
      40% of East Asians inherit an inactive ALDH2*2 variant, which has a
      lysine-for-glutamate substitution at position 487 (E487K), and show a
      characteristic alcohol flush reaction after drinking and a higher risk for
      gastrointestinal cancers. Here we report the characterization of knockin mice in 
      which the ALDH2(E487K) mutation is inserted into the endogenous murine Aldh2
      locus. These mutants recapitulate essentially all human phenotypes including
      impaired clearance of acetaldehyde, increased sensitivity to acute or chronic
      alcohol-induced toxicity, and reduced ALDH2 expression due to a dominant-negative
      effect of the mutation. When treated with a chemical carcinogen, these mutants
      exhibit increased DNA damage response in hepatocytes, pronounced liver injury,
      and accelerated development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, ALDH2
      protein levels are also significantly lower in patient HCC than in peritumor or
      normal liver tissues. Our results reveal that ALDH2 functions as a tumor
      suppressor by maintaining genomic stability in the liver, and the common human
      ALDH2 variant would present a significant risk factor for hepatocarcinogenesis.
      Our study suggests that the ALDH2*2 allele-alcohol interaction may be an even
      greater human public health hazard than previously appreciated.

TI  - Annexin A1 expression in a pooled breast cancer series: association with tumor
      subtypes and prognosis.
PG  - 156
LID - 10.1186/s12916-015-0392-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is a protein related with the carcinogenesis
      process and metastasis formation in many tumors. However, little is known about
      the prognostic value of ANXA1 in breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the association between ANXA1 expression, BRCA1/2 germline carriership, 
      specific tumor subtypes and survival in breast cancer patients. METHODS:
      Clinical-pathological information and follow-up data were collected from nine
      breast cancer studies from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) (n =
      5,752) and from one study of familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2
      mutations (n = 107). ANXA1 expression was scored based on the percentage of
      immunohistochemical staining in tumor cells. Survival analyses were performed
      using a multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: The frequency of ANXA1 positive tumors 
      was higher in familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations than in BCAC
      patients, with 48.6 % versus 12.4 %, respectively; P <0.0001. ANXA1 was also
      highly expressed in BCAC tumors that were poorly differentiated, triple negative,
      EGFR-CK5/6 positive or had developed in patients at a young age. In the first 5
      years of follow-up, patients with ANXA1 positive tumors had a worse breast
      cancer-specific survival (BCSS) than ANXA1 negative (HRadj = 1.35; 95 % CI =
      1.05-1.73), but the association weakened after 10 years (HRadj = 1.13; 95 % CI = 
      0.91-1.40). ANXA1 was a significant independent predictor of survival in HER2+
      patients (10-years BCSS: HRadj = 1.70; 95 % CI = 1.17-2.45). CONCLUSIONS: ANXA1
      is overexpressed in familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations and
      correlated with poor prognosis features: triple negative and poorly
      differentiated tumors. ANXA1 might be a biomarker candidate for breast cancer
      survival prediction in high risk groups such as HER2+ cases.

TI  - Real-time virtual sonography examination and biopsy for suspicious breast lesions
      identified on MRI alone.
PG  - 1064-72
LID - 10.1007/s00330-015-3892-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess whether there is a potential
      additional value of real-time virtual sonography (RVS) to second-look ultrasound 
      (US) examination and biopsy for breast lesions identified on MRI alone. METHODS: 
      A retrospective review of the records of 70 consecutive patients (78 lesions)
      with breast abnormalities identified on MRI alone was performed. All suspicious
      enhancing lesions were subsequently evaluated with second-look US. Lesions not
      observed on second-look US underwent RVS. Pathological findings were confirmed by
      subsequent percutaneous biopsy or excision. RESULTS: Of the 78 MRI-detected
      lesions, second-look US correlation was made in 50 (64 %), including 22 malignant
      and 28 benign lesions. The remaining 28 lesions (36 %) were scheduled to undergo 
      RVS. Four lesions were not visible on the second breast MRI. The remaining 24
      lesions were RVS correlated and underwent RVS-guided biopsy; these included seven
      malignant and 17 benign lesions. Overall, 74 of 74 (100 %) true MRI-detected
      lesions were confirmed by histological results without using MRI-guided breast
      biopsy. The cancer rate was 29 %. CONCLUSIONS: RVS can increase the sonographic
      detection and biopsy rate of lesions identified on breast MRI alone. KEY POINTS: 
      * All 74 MRI-detected lesions were confirmed without using MRI-guided biopsy. *
      Four lesions were not visible on second breast MRI. * RVS can increase
      sonographic detection of lesions identified on breast MRI alone. * RVS-guided
      breast biopsy can be an alternative to MRI-guided biopsy.

TI  - Hormonal contraception and postmenopausal hormone therapy in Spain: time trends
      and patterns of use.
PG  - 1138-46
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000000487 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe time trends in and patterns of use of
      hormonal contraception and postmenopausal hormone therapy and to identify factors
      associated with their use among Spanish women. METHODS: We performed a
      cross-sectional analysis using data from 1,954 population controls (aged 24-85 y)
      in 12 provinces of Spain who were enrolled in the Multi Case-Control Spain study 
      (2007-2013). Data were collected from a questionnaire conducted face-to-face by
      trained personnel. We collected information on sociodemographic factors,
      lifestyle, sleep patterns, reproductive history, and occupational history.
      RESULTS: Overall, 48.5% of Spanish women reported ever use of hormonal
      contraception, and 9.8% of women in the postmenopausal group reported use of
      postmenopausal hormone therapy. Younger cohorts used hormonal contraception for a
      longer period, whereas postmenopausal hormone therapy use dramatically dropped in
      the 2000s. Women with higher education levels (including education of partners)
      and smoking history were the most probable users of hormonal contraception,
      whereas inverse associations were observed among housewives, obese women, and
      nulliparous women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy use was associated with a
      surgical or therapeutic cause of menopause and with occupational history of
      rotating shifts. CONCLUSIONS: In this Spanish population, several demographic,
      lifestyle, occupational, and reproductive factors are associated with use of
      hormonal compounds. Characterizing hormonal users and monitoring trends in the
      use of these hormonal compounds are essential from a public health perspective.

LID - 9050 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: RLIP (Ral-interacting protein)-76/RalBP11 (Ral-binding protein-1), a
      multifunctional protein and stress-inducible non-ABC transporter, have been
      proven to serve as a critical role in cancer development and progression;
      however, little is known about the pathological role of RLIP76 in breast cancer
      patients. The study aimed to determine the correlation between RLIP76 expression 
      in breast cancer patient and clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using
      RT-PCR and Western blot, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of RLIP76
      were determined in breast cancer and adjacent normal mammary tissues. The
      relationship of RLIP76 expression with clinical characteristics of 245 breast
      cancer patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the present
      study, our results indicated that RLIP76 mRNA and protein were highly expressed
      in the breast cancer tissues while compared with adjacent normal mammary tissues 
      and the correlation with RLIP76 protein expression was significantly associated
      with age (the non-ABC transporter, stage and the expression were significantly
      associated-T2 vs. T3-T4, p < 0.01), lymph node metastasis (N0-N1 vs. N2-N3, p <
      0.01), and PR (positive vs. negative, p < 0.01) in breast cancer patients;
      furthermore, we also found that RLIP76 protein overexpression was an unfavorable 
      prognostic factor in the patients suffered from breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      RLIP76 overexpression serves as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in breast
      cancer patients.

TI  - Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis of Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma:
      Experience of a Major Chinese Cancer Center.
PG  - e0131409
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0131409 [doi]
AB  - Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare heterogeneous group of primary
      breast malignancies, with low hormone receptor expression and poor outcomes. To
      date, no prognostic markers for this tumor have been validated. The current study
      was undertaken to evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics, the response to
      various therapeutic regimens and the prognosis of MBCs in a large cohort of
      patients from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital in China. Ninety cases
      of MBCs diagnosed in our hospital between January 2000 and September 2014 were
      retrieved from the archives. In general, MBCs presented with larger size, a lower
      rate of lymph node metastasis, and demonstrated more frequent local
      recurrence/distant metastasis than 1,090 stage-matched cases of invasive
      carcinoma of no specific type (IDC-NST), independent of the status of estrogen
      receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      expressions. The five-year disease-free survival (DFS) of MBC was significantly
      worse than IDC-NST. Using univariate analysis, lymph node metastasis, advanced
      clinical stage at diagnosis, high tumor proliferation rate assessed by Ki-67
      labeling, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression/gene
      amplification were associated significantly with reduced DFS, while decreased OS 
      was associated significantly with lymph node metastasis and EGFR
      overexpression/gene amplification. With multivariate analysis, lymph node status 
      was an independent predictor for DFS, and lymph node status and EGFR
      overexpression/gene amplification were independent predictors for OS. Histologic 
      subtyping and molecular subgrouping of MBCs were not significant factors in
      prognosis. We also found that MBCs were insensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
      routine chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. This study indicates that MBC is an 
      aggressive type of breast cancer with poor prognosis, and that identification and
      optimization of an effective comprehensive therapeutic regimen is needed.

TI  - Body Mass Index, PAM50 Subtype, and Outcomes in Node-Positive Breast Cancer:
      CALGB 9741 (Alliance).
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djv179 [doi]
LID - djv179 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity at diagnosis is associated with poor prognosis in women with 
      breast cancer, but few reports have been adjusted for treatment factors. METHODS:
      CALGB 9741 was a randomized trial of dose density and sequence of chemotherapy
      for node-positive breast cancer. All patients received doxorubicin,
      cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, dosed by actual body weight. Height and weight 
      at diagnosis were abstracted from patient records, and the PAM50 assay was
      performed from archived specimens using the NanoString platform. Relationships
      between body mass index (BMI), PAM50, and recurrence-free and overall survival
      (RFS and OS) were evaluated using proportional hazards regression, adjusting for 
      number of involved nodes, estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor size, menopausal
      status, drug sequence, and dose density. All statistical tests were two-sided.
      RESULTS: Baseline height and weight were available for 1909 of 2005 enrolled
      patients; 1272 additionally had subtype determination by PAM50. Median baseline
      BMI was 27.4kg/m(2). After 11 years of median follow-up, there were 619 RFS
      events and 543 deaths. Baseline BMI was a statistically significant predictor of 
      RFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for each five-unit increase in BMI = 1.08, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 1.02 to 1.14, P = .01) and OS (adjusted HR = 1.08, 95%
      CI = 1.01 to 1.14, P = .02) BMI and molecular phenotypes were independent
      prognostic factors for RFS, with no statistically significant interactions
      detected. CONCLUSIONS: BMI at diagnosis was a statistically significant
      prognostic factor in a group of patients receiving optimally dosed chemotherapy. 
      Additional research is needed to determine the impact of weight loss on breast
      cancer outcomes and to evaluate whether this impact is maintained across tumor
      subtypes.

TI  - S100P and HYAL2 as prognostic markers for patients with triple-negative breast

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a group of very aggressive breast
      tumours, characterised by lack of expression of oestrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PR) and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2/HER2).
      Nevertheless, TNBCs show different clinical characteristics and are very diverse 
      regarding prognostic outcome. So far, only a few prognostic markers for TNBC have
      been reported that could be helpful for therapeutic stratification. Here we have 
      analysed the expression of S100P and HYAL2 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a 
      TNBC cohort of 98 patients with a follow-up for recurrence and death. TNBC
      patients with high expression of both proteins showed significantly shorter
      progression-free survival (PFS) (mean PFS=35.9months, P=0.001) compared to TNBC
      patients with high expression levels of only one of the proteins (mean
      PFS=69.4months) and to TNBC patients with low expression of both proteins (mean
      PFS=83.3months). Moreover, multivariate Cox-regression model showed the combined 
      expression of S100P and HYAL2 as independent prognostic factor for PFS (P=0.001).
      The expression of S100P and HYAL2 indicated similar prognostic effect to the
      overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients. In addition, high expression levels of
      both S100P and HYAL2 showed significant association with different
      clinicopathological characteristics, such as more recurrence events (P=0.004),
      and higher occurrence of metastasis (P=0.002). Our study proposes S100P and HYAL2
      as potential prognostic markers for TNBC.

TI  - Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy in early breast cancer: what factors lead
      patients to discontinue treatment?
PG  - 469-73
LID - 10.5301/tj.5000376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are standard hormone therapy (HT) for the 
      adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal endocrine-sensitive early breast cancer.
      Treatment discontinuation due to toxicity is an important issue that may help
      clinicians identify effective clinical interventions to allow adequate treatment 
      duration. We reviewed the main reasons for interruption of AIs at our institution
      from 2006 to 2009. METHODS: 236 patients treated with adjuvant AIs were eligible 
      for analysis. Median age was 64 years (35-89), median follow-up 53 months (6-60).
      Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was taxane based in 47 patients and anthracycline
      based in 43 patients. 118 patients had received letrozole, 101 anastrozole, and
      17 exemestane. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (10%) needed discontinuation of the 
      first AI assigned as a result of toxicity. Grade 2/3 arthralgia was the main
      reason for discontinuation in 13/24 patients. No differences in the incidence of 
      arthralgia were noted in patients who had received taxanes or anthracyclines.
      Headache, alopecia, itching, diffuse skin reaction, allergic reaction with
      hypertensive crisis, xerostomia and xerophthalmia, insomnia and somnolence were
      the other reasons for discontinuation. In multivariate logistic regression
      analysis, age (65 years) and HT were independent factors associated with the
      onset of arthralgia (p = 0.006 and p = 0.008, respectively; OR 2.65, 95% CI
      1.32-5.31). Alternative HT (AI or tamoxifen) was offered to patients who wanted
      or needed to permanently interrupt the ongoing drug. CONCLUSIONS: In our
      analysis, 10% of patients discontinued the first AI assigned because of toxicity.
      Median time course of all adverse events leading to HT discontinuation was 155
      days and 135 days for arthralgia. A switch to alternative HT with toxicity
      monitoring is a recommended option for avoiding premature and permanent
      interruption of an effective treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Obesity is associated with poorer outcomes in patients with hormone
      receptor-positive breast cancers, but this association is not well established
      for women with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Here, we investigated the
      prognostic effects of body mass index (BMI) on clinical outcomes in patients with
      TNBC. METHODS: We identified 1106 patients with TNBC who met the inclusion
      criteria and were treated between January 2002 and June 2012. Clinical and
      biological features were collected to evaluate the relation between BMI and
      breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) after
      controlling for other clinically significant variables. RESULTS: Of 1106
      patients, 656 (59.3%) were normal weight (BMI </=24) and 450 patients (40.7%)
      were overweight(BMI>24). Median follow-up time was 44.8 months. Breast cancer
      specific death was observed in 140 patients. After adjusting for
      clinicopathologic risk factors, overweight was associated with OS (hazard ratio
      [HR]: 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-2.06, P =0.028) but not BCSS (HR: 
      1.34, 95% CI: 0.90-2.01, P =0.15)in all the patients with TNBC. When stratified
      with menopausal status, overweight was associated with BCSS and OS (HR: 2.27, 95%
      CI: 1.11-4.63, P = 0.024 and HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.21-3.87, P = 0.010,
      respectively) in premenopausal women. BMI was not associated with BCSS or OS in
      postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight is an independent prognostic factor
      of OS in all women with TNBC, and menopause status may be a mitigating factor.
      Among premenopausal women, overweight women are at a greater risk of poor
      prognosis than normal weight women. If validated, these findings should be
      considered in developing preventive programs.

AB  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is a rare type of triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) characterized by the presence of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene. The molecular
      underpinning of breast AdCCs other than the MYB-NFIB fusion gene remains largely 
      unexplored. Here we sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic
      alterations of breast AdCCs. We performed whole-exome sequencing, followed by
      orthogonal validation, of 12 breast AdCCs to determine the landscape of somatic
      mutations and gene copy number alterations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
      and reverse-transcription PCR were used to define the presence of MYB gene
      rearrangements and MYB-NFIB chimeric transcripts. Unlike common forms of TNBC, we
      found that AdCCs have a low mutation rate (0.27 non-silent mutations/Mb), lack
      mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA and display a heterogeneous constellation of known
      cancer genes affected by somatic mutations, including MYB, BRAF, FBXW7, SMARCA5, 
      SF3B1 and FGFR2. MYB and TLN2 were affected by somatic mutations in two cases
      each. Akin to salivary gland AdCCs, breast AdCCs were found to harbour mutations 
      targeting chromatin remodelling, cell adhesion, RNA biology, ubiquitination and
      canonical signalling pathway genes. We observed that, although breast AdCCs had
      rather simple genomes, they likely display intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity at 
      diagnosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the mutational burden 
      and mutational repertoire of breast AdCCs are more similar to those of salivary
      gland AdCCs than to those of other types of TNBCs, emphasizing the importance of 
      histological subtyping of TNBCs. Furthermore, our data provide direct evidence
      that AdCCs harbour a distinctive mutational landscape and genomic structure,
      irrespective of the disease site of origin.

AB  - Since the initial recognition of the metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) as a 
      metastasis-relevant gene approximately 20 years ago, our appreciation for the
      complex role of the MTA family of coregulatory proteins in human cancer has
      profoundly grown. MTA proteins consist of six family members with similar
      structural units and act as central signaling nodes for integrating upstream
      signals into regulatory chromatin-remodeling networks, leading to regulation of
      gene expression in cancer cells. Substantial experimental and clinical evidence
      demonstrates that MTA proteins, particularly MTA1, are frequently deregulated in 
      a wide range of human cancers. The MTA family governs cell survival, the invasive
      and metastatic phenotypes of cancer cells, and the aggressiveness of cancer and
      the prognosis of patients with MTA1 overexpressing cancers. Our discussion here
      highlights our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functional 
      roles of MTA proteins in cancer progression and expands upon the potential
      implications of MTA proteins in cancer biology and cancer therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combined efficacy analysis of the TEXT and SOFT trials showed a
      significant disease-free survival benefit with exemestane plus ovarian function
      suppression (OFS) compared with tamoxifen plus OFS. We present patient-reported
      outcomes from these trials. METHODS: Between Nov 7, 2003, and April 7, 2011, 4717
      premenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer were enrolled in
      TEXT or SOFT to receive unmasked adjuvant treatment with 5 years of exemestane
      plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue
      triptorelin, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral ovarian irradiation were used
      to achieve OFS. Chemotherapy use was optional. Randomisation with permuted blocks
      was done with the International Breast Cancer Study Group's internet-based system
      and was stratified by chemotherapy use and status of lymph nodes. Patients
      completed a quality of life (QoL) form comprising several global and symptom
      indicators at baseline, every 6 months for 24 months, and then every year during 
      years 3 to 6. Differences in the change of QoL from baseline between the two
      treatments were tested at 6 months, 24 months, and 60 months with mixed-models
      for repeated measures for each trial with and without chemotherapy and overall.
      The analysis was by intention to treat. At the time of analysis, the median
      follow-up was 5.7 years (IQR 3.7-6.9); treatment and follow-up of patients
      continue. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, as NCT00066703
      (TEXT) and NCT00066690 (SOFT). FINDINGS: Patients on tamoxifen plus OFS were more
      affected by hot flushes and sweats over 5 years than were those on exemestane
      plus OFS, although these symptoms improved. Patients on exemestane plus OFS
      reported more vaginal dryness, greater loss of sexual interest, and difficulties 
      becoming aroused than did patients on tamoxifen plus OFS; these differences
      persisted over time. An increase in bone or joint pain was more pronounced,
      particularly in the short term, in patients on exemestane plus OFS than patients 
      on tamoxifen plus OFS. Changes in global QoL indicators from baseline were small 
      and similar between treatments over the 5 years. INTERPRETATION: Overall, from a 
      QoL perspective, there is no strong indication to favour either exemestane plus
      OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. The distinct effects of the two treatments on the
      burden of endocrine symptoms need to be addressed with patients individually.

TI  - Stathmin and phospho-stathmin protein signature is associated with survival
      outcomes of breast cancer patients.
PG  - 22227-38
AB  - Currently, Stathmin1 (STMN1) and phospho-STMN1 levels in breast cancers and their
      clinical implications are unknown. We examined the expression of STMN1 and its
      serine phospho-site (Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63) status by
      immunohistochemistry. Using Cox regression analysis, a STMN1 expression signature
      and phosphorylation profile plus clinicopathological characteristics
      (STMN1-E/P/C) was developed in the training set (n = 204) and applied to the
      validation set (n = 106). This tool enabled us to separate breast cancer patients
      into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different disease-free survival
      (DFS) rates (P < 0.001). Importantly, this STMN1-E/P/C model had a greater
      prognostic value than the traditional TNM classifier, especially in luminal
      subtype breast cancer (P = 0.002). Further analysis showed that patients in the
      low-risk group would benefit more from adjuvant paclitaxel-based chemotherapy (P 
      = 0.002). In conclusion, the STMN1-E/P/C signature is a reliable prognostic
      indicator for luminal subtype breast cancer and may predict the therapeutic
      response to paclitaxel-based treatments, potentially facilitating individualized 
      management.

TI  - Efficacy and safety analysis of trastuzumab and paclitaxel based regimen plus
      carboplatin or epirubicin as neoadjuvant therapy for clinical stage II-III,
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients: a phase 2, open-label, multicenter,
      randomized trial.
PG  - 18683-92
AB  - This trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety between epirubicin (E)
      and carboplatin (C) in combination with paclitaxel (P) and trastuzumab (H) in
      neoadjuvant setting. In 13 Chinese cancer centers, 100 patients with
      HER2-positive, locally advanced breast cancer were 1:1 randomized to receive
      medication as follows: trastuzumab and paclitaxel weekly combined with
      carboplatin weekly for PCH group, or epirubicin every 3 weeks for PEH group.
      Patients were given 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was
      pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, which was no significant difference in
      PCH and PEH regimen (39.1% vs. 48.8%; p=0.365). However, PEH regimen achieved
      higher pCR in luminal-B (HER2-poitive) subgroup (55.0% vs. 24.0%; p = 0.033), but
      not in ERBB2+ subgroup (42.9% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.355). PEH regimen showed a
      favorable efficacy in PIK3CA mutated subgroup (69.2% vs.23.5%, p=0.012). No
      significant difference was observed in the subgroup analysis of TP53 mutation
      status, PTEN expression, FCGR2A SNP and FCGR3A SNP. Both regimens as neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy achieve similar efficacy and safety. PEH might improve pCR rate,
      especially in the luminal-B subtype and PIK3CA mutation subtype. PEH is feasible 
      and less likely to increase the incidence of acute cardiac events compared to
      PCH.

AB  - Currently available human tumour cell line panels consist of a small number of
      lines in each lineage that generally fail to retain the phenotype of the original
      patient tumour. Here we develop a cell culture medium that enables us to
      routinely establish cell lines from diverse subtypes of human ovarian cancers
      with >95% efficiency. Importantly, the 25 new ovarian tumour cell lines described
      here retain the genomic landscape, histopathology and molecular features of the
      original tumours. Furthermore, the molecular profile and drug response of these
      cell lines correlate with distinct groups of primary tumours with different
      outcomes. Thus, tumour cell lines derived using this methodology represent a
      significantly improved platform to study human tumour pathophysiology and
      response to therapy.

      molecules, regulating numerous biological processes. DJ-1 is one of the most
      evolutionarily conserved proteins across species, and mutations in DJ-1 have been
      linked to some cases of Parkinson's disease. Here we show that DJ-1 maintains
      cellular metabolic homeostasis via modulating ROS levels in murine skeletal
      muscles, revealing a role of DJ-1 in maintaining efficient fuel utilization. We
      demonstrate that, in the absence of DJ-1, ROS uncouple mitochondrial respiration 
      and activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which triggers Warburg-like metabolic 
      reprogramming in muscle cells. Accordingly, DJ-1 knockout mice exhibit higher
      energy expenditure and are protected from obesity, insulin resistance and
      diabetes in the setting of fuel surplus. Our data suggest that promoting
      mitochondrial uncoupling may be a potential strategy for the treatment of
      obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

AB  - In 2011, the Leicestershire Clinical Genetics Department in collaboration with
      Macmillan Cancer Support initiated a project called Supporting Families with
      Cancer (SFWC). The project aimed to raise awareness of inherited cancers amongst 
      both healthcare professionals and the general public and develop a
      patient-centred collaborative approach to cancer treatment and support services. 
      This paper describes the project's development of a range of community outreach
      events and a training scheme for primary healthcare professionals designed to
      improve familial cancer referral rates in Leicester. Following consultation with 
      patients and support groups, a series of interactive 'medical supermarket' events
      were held in Leicester. These events focused on providing patients with a forum
      for sharing research data, information about diagnosis and treatments and access 
      to support groups and other allied healthcare services with additional
      information being made available digitally via SFWC webpages and a series of
      short videos available on a YouTube channel. Qualitative and quantitative data
      presented here indicate that the SFWC medical supermarket model has been well
      received by patients and offers a patient-centred, holistic approach to cancer
      treatment.

TI  - Final 10-year results of the Breast International Group 2-98 phase III trial and 
      the role of Ki67 in predicting benefit of adjuvant docetaxel in patients with
      oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer.

AB  - AIM: Breast International Group (BIG) 2-98 is a randomised phase III trial that
      tested the effect of adding docetaxel, either in sequence to or in combination
      with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy, in women with node-positive
      breast cancer (BC). Here, we present the 10-year final trial safety and efficacy 
      analyses. We also report an exploratory analysis on the predictive value of Ki67 
      for docetaxel efficacy, in the BIG 2-98 and using a pooled analysis of three
      other randomised trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 2887 patients were randomly
      assigned in a 2x2 trial design to one of four treatments. The primary objective
      was to evaluate the overall efficacy of docetaxel on disease free survival (DFS).
      Secondary objectives included comparisons of sequential docetaxel versus
      sequential control arm, safety and overall survival (OS). Ki67 expression was
      centrally evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of
      10.1years, the addition of docetaxel did not significantly improve DFS or OS
      (hazard ratio (HR)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.81-1.04; P=0.16 and
      HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.76-1.03; P=0.11, respectively). Sequential docetaxel did not
      improve DFS compared to the sequential control arm (HR=0.86, 95% CI=0.72-1.03;
      P=0.10). In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours with Ki6714%, the addition
      of docetaxel resulted in 5.4% improvement in 10-year OS (P=0.03, test for
      interaction=0.1). In a multivariate model, there was a trend for improved DFS and
      OS in ER-positive patients with high Ki67 and treated with docetaxel (HR=0.79,
      95% CI=0.63-1.01; P=0.05 and HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.57-1.01; P=0.06, respectively). A 
      pooled analysis of four randomised trials showed a benefit of taxanes in highly
      proliferative ER-positive disease but not in low proliferating tumours
      (interaction test P=0.01). CONCLUSION: The DFS benefit previously demonstrated
      with sequential docetaxel is no longer observed at 10years. However, an
      exploratory analysis suggested a benefit of docetaxel in patients with highly
      proliferative ER-positive BC.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs near ZNF365 at 10q21.2 that 
      are associated with both breast cancer risk and mammographic density. To identify
      the most likely causal SNPs, we fine mapped the association signal by genotyping 
      428 SNPs across the region in 89,050 European and 12,893 Asian case and control
      subjects from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We identified four
      independent sets of correlated, highly trait-associated variants (iCHAVs), three 
      of which were located within ZNF365. The most strongly risk-associated SNP,
      rs10995201 in iCHAV1, showed clear evidence of association with both estrogen
      receptor (ER)-positive (OR = 0.85 [0.82-0.88]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.87
      [0.82-0.91]) disease, and was also the SNP most strongly associated with percent 
      mammographic density. iCHAV2 (lead SNP, chr10: 64,258,684:D) and iCHAV3 (lead
      SNP, rs7922449) were also associated with ER-positive (OR = 0.93 [0.91-0.95] and 
      OR = 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.95 [0.91-0.98] and OR = 1.08
      [1.04-1.13]) disease. There was weaker evidence for iCHAV4, located 5' of ADO,
      associated only with ER-positive breast cancer (OR = 0.93 [0.90-0.96]). We found 
      12, 17, 18, and 2 candidate causal SNPs for breast cancer in iCHAVs 1-4,
      respectively. Chromosome conformation capture analysis showed that iCHAV2
      interacts with the ZNF365 and NRBF2 (more than 600 kb away) promoters in normal
      and cancerous breast epithelial cells. Luciferase assays did not identify SNPs
      that affect transactivation of ZNF365, but identified a protective haplotype in
      iCHAV2, associated with silencing of the NRBF2 promoter, implicating this gene in
      the etiology of breast cancer.

AB  - Anthracyclines are an important component of cancer treatments; however, their
      use is limited by the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. There are limited data on the
      occurrence of heart failure and the value of baseline and follow-up measurements 
      of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) in the current era. Therefore,
      the objectives of the present study were twofold: (1) to characterize the
      occurrence of and risk factors for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs:
      symptomatic heart failure and cardiac death) in a large contemporaneous
      population of adult patients treated with anthracyclines and (2) to test the
      value of LVEF and LV dimensions obtained using echocardiography in the prediction
      of MACE. Five thousand fifty-seven patients were studied, of whom 124 (2.4%)
      developed MACE. Of the total cohort, 2,285 patients had an available
      echocardiogram pre-chemotherapy. Patients with MACE were older (p <0.0001),
      predominantly men (p = 0.03), and with a higher incidence of cardiovascular risk 
      factors and cardiac treatments. Patients with hematologic cancers had a higher
      incidence of cardiac events than patients with breast cancer (4.2% vs 0.7%, p
      <0.0001). Baseline LVEF, LVEF </=5 points above the lower limits of normal, and
      LV internal diameter were predictive of the rate of occurrence of MACE. In
      conclusion, older patients with hematologic cancers and patients with a baseline 
      LVEF </=5 points above the lower limit of normal have higher incidence of MACE
      and should be closely monitored.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: We have previously shown that pregnancy is safe following 
      breast cancer, even in endocrine sensitive disease. Yet infertility remains
      common following systemic treatment. To date, no study has evaluated the safety
      of assisted reproductive technology (ART) after breast cancer treatment. In this 
      study, we evaluated the impact of ART on pregnancy and long-term outcomes of
      young breast cancer survivors. METHODS: This is a multi-centre retrospective
      study in which women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2009,
      and had a pregnancy following breast cancer diagnosis were eligible. Patients
      were divided into two groups according to whether ART following primary systemic 
      therapy was performed to achieve pregnancy. We evaluated the association between 
      ART use and clinic-pathological characteristics, pregnancy outcome and long-term 
      breast cancer outcome. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients were evaluated; of whom
      25 underwent ART. No significant differences in tumour characteristics were
      observed between both groups, except for histological grade 3 tumours, which were
      fewer in the ART group (36% versus 59%, p=0.033). Around 90% of patients received
      primary adjuvant chemotherapy and more than 50% had an endocrine sensitive
      disease. Patients in the ART group were older at diagnosis (31.4 versus 33.7
      years, p=0.009), at conception (38 versus 35 years, p<0.001), and experienced
      more miscarriages (23.5 versus 12.6%, p=0.082). Full term pregnancies were
      achieved in 77% and 76% of the spontaneous and ART groups, respectively. Mean
      follow-up between conception and last follow-up was 63 and 50 months in the
      spontaneous and ART groups, respectively with no difference in breast cancer
      outcome observed between the two groups (p=0.54). CONCLUSION: Pregnancy using ART
      in women with history of breast cancer is feasible and does not seem to be
      detrimental to cancer outcome. Larger studies are needed to further confirm this 
      observation.

TI  - DNA Methylation Affects the SP1-regulated Transcription of FOXF2 in Breast Cancer
      Cells.
PG  - 19173-83
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.636126 [doi]
AB  - FOXF2 (forkhead box F2) is a mesenchyme-specific transcription factor that plays 
      a critical role in tissue homeostasis through the maintenance of epithelial
      polarity. In a previous study, we demonstrated that FOXF2 is specifically
      expressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells and functions as an
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition suppressor. FOXF2 deficiency enhances the
      metastatic ability of BLBC cells through activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition program, but reduces cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate
      that CpG island methylation of the FOXF2 proximal promoter region is involved in 
      the regulatory mechanism of the subtype-specific expression of FOXF2 in breast
      cancer cells. DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B commonly or individually contributed to
      this DNA methylation in different breast cancer cells. SP1 regulated the
      transcriptional activity of FOXF2 through direct binding to the proximal promoter
      region, whereas this binding was abrogated through DNA methylation. FOXF2
      mediated the SP1-regulated suppression of progression and promotion of
      proliferation of non-methylated BLBC cells. Thus, we conclude that the
      subtype-specific expression and function of FOXF2 in breast cancer cells are
      regulated through the combined effects of DNA methylation and SP1 transcriptional
      regulation.

TI  - Circulating High-Molecular-Weight (HMW) Adiponectin Level Is Related with Breast 
      Cancer Risk Better than Total Adiponectin: A Case-Control Study.
PG  - e0129246
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129246 [doi]
AB  - The level of total adiponectin, a mixture of different adiponectin forms, has
      been reported associated with breast cancer risk with inconsistent results.
      Whether the different forms play different roles in breast cancer risk prediction
      is unclear. To examine this, we measured total and high molecular weight (HMW)
      adiponectin in a case-control study (1167 sets). Higher circulating HMW
      adiponectin was negatively associated with breast cancer risk after adjusting for
      menopausal status and family history of breast cancer (P=0.024). We analyzed the 
      relationship between adiponectin and breast cancer risk in 6 subgroups. Higher
      circulating HMW adiponectin was also negatively associated with breast cancer
      risk (P=0.020, 0.014, 0.035) in the subgroups of postmenopausal women, negative
      family history of breast cancer, BMI>=24.0. Total adiponectin was positively
      associated with breast cancer (P=0.028) in the subgroup of BMI<=24.0. Higher
      HMW/total adiponectin ratio was negatively associated with breast cancer
      (P=0.019) in the subgroup of postmenopausal women. Interestingly, in the subgroup
      of women with family history of breast cancer, higher circulating total and HMW
      adiponectin were positively associated with breast cancer risk (P=0.034, 0.0116).
      This study showed different forms of circulating adiponectin levels might play
      different roles in breast cancer risk. A higher circulating HMW adiponectin is
      associated with a decreased breast cancer risk, especially in postmenopausal,
      without family history of breast cancer or BMI>=24.0 subgroups, whereas higher
      circulating HMW adiponectin levels is a risk factor in women with a family
      history of breast cancer. Further investigation of different forms of adiponectin
      on breast cancer risk is needed.

TI  - A cross sectional study on the motivators for Asian women to attend opportunistic
      mammography screening in a private hospital in Malaysia: the MyMammo study.
PG  - 548
LID - 10.1186/s12889-015-1892-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, because of limited budgets and lower incidence of breast
      cancer, the majority of Asian countries do not have population-based screening
      programmes, but instead offer opportunistic screening. However, there have been
      few studies which have assessed the motivators for women attending such
      programmes and the appropriateness of the programmes in terms of targeting women 
      at risk. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of 1,619 women
      aged 40 to 74 years attending a subsidized opportunistic screening mammogram from
      October 2011 to October 2013 at a private hospital in Malaysia. Breast cancer
      risk was estimated using the Gail Model and two-step cluster analysis was used to
      examine the motivators of attending screening. RESULTS: Although Malaysia
      comprises 54.5% Malay, 24.5% Chinese and 7.3% Indian, the majority of women in
      the MyMammo Study were Chinese (70.1%) and 99.2% had a <2% ten-year risk of
      breast cancer. The most commonly cited barriers were the perception of not being 
      at risk and fear of painful mammography. We found that highly educated women,
      cited doctors, family and friends as their main motivators. Of those with only
      secondary school education, their main motivators were doctors. CONCLUSIONS:
      Taken together, our results suggest the women attending opportunistic mammography
      screening in Asia are at low risk of breast cancer and this poses challenges to
      cost-effective and equitable strategies for cancer control. We propose that to
      improve uptake of screening mammography, awareness programmes should target both 
      doctors and members of the public.

TI  - International Expert Consensus on Primary Systemic Therapy in the Management of
      Early Breast Cancer: Highlights of the Fifth Symposium on Primary Systemic
      Therapy in the Management of Operable Breast Cancer, Cremona, Italy (2013).
PG  - 90-6
LID - 10.1093/jncimonographs/lgv023 [doi]
AB  - Expert consensus-based recommendations regarding key issues in the use of primary
      (or neoadjuvant) systemic treatment (PST) in patients with early breast cancer
      are a valuable resource for practising oncologists. PST remains a valuable
      therapeutic approach for the assessment of biological antitumor activity and
      clinical efficacy of new treatments in clinical trials. Neoadjuvant trials
      provide endpoints, such as pathological complete response (pCR) to treatment,
      that potentially translate into meaningful improvements in overall survival and
      disease-free survival. Neoadjuvant trials need fewer patients and are less
      expensive than adjuvant trial, and the endpoint of pCR is achieved in months,
      rather than years. For these reasons, the neoadjuvant setting is ideal for
      testing emerging targeted therapies in early breast cancer. Although pCR is an
      early clinical endpoint, its role as a surrogate for long-term outcomes is the
      key issue. New and better predictors of treatment efficacy are needed to improve 
      treatment and outcomes. After PST, accurate management of post-treatment residual
      disease is mandatory. The surgery of the sentinel lymph-node could be an
      acceptable option to spare the axillary dissection in case of clinical negativity
      (N0) of the axilla at the diagnosis and/or after PST. No data exists yet to
      support the modulation of the extent of locoregional radiation therapy on the
      basis of the response attained after PST although trials are underway.

TI  - Population-based analysis of the impact and generalizability of the NSABP-B24
      study on endocrine therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ of the
      breast.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1999, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
      (NSABP)-B24 trial demonstrated that tamoxifen reduced relapse risk in women with 
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and 
      radiotherapy (RT). In 2002, Allred's subgroup analysis showed that tamoxifen
      mainly benefitted estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease. This study evaluates
      the impact and generalizability of these trial findings at the population level. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1989 to 2009, 2061 women with DCIS underwent BCS + RT 
      in British Columbia. The following cohorts were analyzed: (1) pre-NSABP-B24 era
      (1989-1998, N = 417); (2) post-NSABP-B24 era (2000-2009, N = 1548). Cohort 2 was 
      further divided into pre- and post-Allred eras. RESULTS: Endocrine therapy (ET)
      was used in 404/2061 (20%) patients. Median age of patients treated with compared
      with without ET, was 53 versus 57 years, (P < 0.0005). One of 417 (0.2%) versus
      399/1548 (26%) patients took ET before versus after NSABP-B24. Among the
      post-Allred era cohort treated with ET (N = 227), tumors were ER-positive in 65%,
      ER-negative in 1%, and ER-unknown in 33%; whereas of those treated without ET (N 
      = 801), ER was positive in 43%, negative in 15%, and unknown in 42% (P < 0.0005).
      On multivariable analysis of the post-NSABP-B24 era, ET was associated with
      improved event-free survival (EFS) (hazard ratio 0.6; P = 0.02); 5-year EFS were 
      96.9% with ET versus 94.5% without ET. CONCLUSIONS: ET use in DCIS patients
      treated with BCS + RT increased significantly after the NSABP-B24 study. ER+
      disease and younger age were associated with increased ET use. ET was associated 
      with improved EFS, confirming the generalizability of trial data at a population 
      level.

AB  - As recurrence free survival following a breast cancer diagnosis continues to
      improve, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will assume greater importance in
      the breast cancer survivorship research agenda particularly for women receiving
      potentially cardiotoxic therapy. Development of (1) tools to readily identify
      pre-diagnostic risk factors for cardiac dysfunction, (2) well-tolerated
      prophylactic treatments to reduce the risk of cardiac injury, and (3) sensitive
      and affordable monitoring techniques which can identify subclinical toxicity
      prior to a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction are or should be focus
      areas of cardio-oncology research. Since weight as well as cardiorespiratory
      fitness generally decline after a breast cancer diagnosis, behavioral approaches 
      which can improve energy balance and fitness are important to optimize
      cardiovascular health in all breast cancer survivors not just those undergoing
      cardiotoxic therapy. These goals are likely best achieved by partnerships between
      cardiologists, oncologists and internists such as those initiated with the
      formation of the International CardiOncology Society (ICOS) and the NCI Community
      Cardiotoxicity Task Force.

TI  - Prognosis of invasive breast cancer after adjuvant therapy evaluated with VEGF
      microvessel density and microvascular imaging.
PG  - 8755-60
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-3610-0 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ultrasonographic
      microvascular imaging in the evaluation of prognosis of patients with invasive
      breast cancer treated by adjuvant therapies. A total of 121 patients with
      invasive breast cancer underwent ultrasonographic contrast-enhanced imaging,
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining, and microvessel density (MVD)
      counts. The parameters of microvascular imaging and the expression of VEGF and
      MVD in primary breast cancer were calculated. The correlation between these
      factors and the overall and progression-free survival rate were analyzed using
      the Kaplan-Meier method. Among 121 cases, the positive VEGF cases were 75 and
      negative ones were 46. The cut point of 52.3 was calculated by the regressive
      curve for MVD counts. The data showed the mean intensity (MI) was positively
      associated with both the MVD counts (r = .51, p < .001) and VEGF expression (r = 
      .35, p < .001). For the prognosis of patients, high VEGF expression and MVD
      counts were associated with reduced progressive and survival times (PFS, p = .032
      and p = .034; OS, p = .041 and p = .038, respectively). The correlation between
      parameters of microvascular imaging, VEGF expressive status, and the MVD counts
      were established. The cut point of mean intensity (MI = 40) was used to
      investigate as an independent predictor for PFS (p = .021) and OS (p = .025),
      respectively, due to a strong correlation between MVD counts and VEGF expression 
      in patients with invasive breast cancer. The microvascular imaging could be a
      visual and helpful tool to predict the prognosis of patients with invasive breast
      cancer treated by adjuvant therapies.

TI  - A network meta-analysis of everolimus plus exemestane versus chemotherapy in the 
      first- and second-line treatment of estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast 
      cancer.
PG  - 95-117
LID - 10.1007/s10549-015-3453-9 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy
      to exemestane plus everolimus (EXE/EVE) through a network meta-analysis (NMA) of 
      randomized controlled trials. NMA methods extend standard pairwise meta-analysis 
      to allow simultaneous comparison of multiple treatments while maintaining
      randomization of individual studies. The method enables "direct" evidence (i.e., 
      evidence from studies directly comparing two interventions) and "indirect"
      evidence (i.e., evidence from studies that do not compare the two interventions
      directly) to be pooled under the assumption of evidence consistency. We used NMA 
      to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) curves 
      in 34 studies, and response rate (RR) and the hazard ratios (HRs) of the PFS/TTP 
      in 36 studies. A number needed to treat (NNT) analysis was also performed as well
      as descriptive comparison of reported toxicities. The NMA for PFS/TTP curves and 
      for HR shows EXE/EVE is more efficacious than capecitabine plus sunitinib, CMF,
      megestrol acetate and tamoxifen, with an average of related-PFS/TTP difference
      ranging from about 10 months for capecitabine plus sunitinib to more than 6
      months for tamoxifen. The NMA for overall RR shows that EXE/EVE provides a better
      RR than bevacizumab plus capecitabine, capecitabine, capecitabine plus sorafenib,
      capecitabine plus sunitinib, CMF, gemcitabine plus epirubicin plus paclitaxel,
      EVE plus tamoxifen, EXE, FEC, megestrol acetate, mitoxantrone, and tamoxifen.
      Finally, the NMA for NNT shows that EXE/EVE is more beneficial as compared to
      BMF, capecitabine, capecitabine plus sunitinib, CMF, FEC, megestrol acetate,
      mitoxantrone, and tamoxifen. The combination of EXE/EVE as first- or second-line 
      therapy for ER+ve/HER2-ve metastatic breast cancer is more efficacious than
      several chemotherapy regimens that were reported in the literature. Toxicities
      also favored EXE/EVE in most instances.

AB  - Despite advances in early detection, prevention and treatment of breast cancer,
      the mortality of breast cancer patients did not decrease considerably in the last
      years. Metastatic breast cancer remains incurable. There is compelling evidence
      that dissemination of breast cancer cells at distant sites is an early event. At 
      the time of detection and diagnosis, patients have disseminated breast cancer
      cells in the bone marrow. Only in half of these patients the disseminated cells
      proliferate and generate metastases, typically in 3-5 years for ER negative
      breast tumors and 10-15 years for ER positive breast tumors. In other patients
      metastases never develop. The ability to predict which patients will develop
      metastases and to devise strategies to interfere with this process hinges on
      understanding the mechanisms underlying growth at the metastatic site. In turn,
      this requires novel experimental systems that model in vitro the survival,
      dormancy and proliferation of disseminated cancer cells.We have established such 
      experimental systems that model the bone microenvironment of the breast cancer
      metastatic niche. These systems are based on 3D complex cultures of human bone
      marrow stromal cells and breast cancer cell lines in collagen biomatrices. We
      identified conditions in which cancer cells are dormant, and conditions in which 
      they proliferate and we validated the results in vivo. Dormant cancer cells were 
      able to proliferate upon transfer into supportive microenvironment or upon
      manipulation of signaling pathways that control dormancy. These experimental
      systems will be instrumental in screening new compounds for metastasis studies
      and particularly in studying the pathways that control cellular dormancy. We
      provide in this chapter detailed protocols for these complex 3D coculture
      systems.

AB  - Embryonic explant culture is a powerful technique to observe tissue morphogenesis
      ex vivo, and is particularly useful for monitoring embryonic mammary gland
      development. It has been established that mammary cell lineage specification
      occurs during embryogenesis, although much remains to be elucidated with respect 
      to how this occurs. During mammary specification, mammary progenitor cells are
      formed. Embryonic mammary development can proceed and be monitored in embryonic
      explant culture. Studies using explant culture will greatly enhance our
      understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate embryonic mammary
      primordial development and mammary progenitor cell specification. We present a
      protocol for culturing explants from mid-gestation mouse embryos so that
      morphogenetic processes and mammary epithelial progenitor cells can be studied
      during embryonic mammary development ex vivo.

AB  - Women from breast cancer families without a demonstrable BRCA1/2 mutation were
      subjected to annual mammography from age 30 years onwards. One-hundred and
      ninety-eight patients were diagnosed prospectively with invasive breast cancer
      and followed for a total of 1513 years. Overall 10-year survival was 88 %.
      Together with our previous report that women in such kindreds had about twice the
      population risk of breast cancer, the combined conclusion was that the overall
      chances of developing breast cancer causing death within 10 years before 50 years
      of age was 1 % or less when subjected to annual mammography and current
      treatment. These are empirical prospective observations which may be used for
      genetic counselling. The majority (160/194 = 84 %) of patients had ER+ and/or low
      grade tumours with 92 % 10-year survival. One minor group of the patients had ER-
      tumours, another small group had high grade tumours with nodal spread, both
      groups were associated with worse prognosis, but the two groups were not mutually
      associated.

TI  - Effect of tumor size on breast cancer-specific survival stratified by joint
      hormone receptor status in a SEER population-based study.
PG  - 22985-95
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The prognostic value of tumor size is variable. We aimed to
      characterize the interaction between tumor size and hormone receptor (HoR) status
      to determine breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM). METHODS: We used the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry to identify 328, 870
      female patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 1990 through 2010.
      Primary study variables included tumor size, joint HoR status and their
      corresponding relationship. Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox proportional hazards
      models with interaction terms were utilized. RESULTS: The multivariable analysis 
      revealed a significant interaction between tumor size and HoR status (P < 0.001).
      Using tumors 61-70 mm in size as the reference for estrogen receptor-negative
      (ER-) and progesterone receptor-negative (PR-) disease, the hazard ratio (HR) for
      BCSM increased with increasing tumor size across nearly all categories. In the
      ER-positive (ER+) and PR-positive (PR+) group, however, patients with tumors > 50
      mm had nearly identical BCSM rates (P = 0.127, P = 0.099 and P = 0.370 for 51-60 
      mm, 71-80 mm and > 80 mm tumors, respectively), whereas BCSM was positively
      correlated with tumors < 51 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The observation of identical HRs for
      BCSM among patients with ER+ and PR+ tumors >50 mm underscores the importance of 
      individualized treatment. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding
      of breast cancer biology.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to (1) develop a decision aid for women
      considering participation in the Sentinel Node Biopsy versus Axillary Clearance 2
      (SNAC-2) breast cancer surgical trial and (2) obtain evidence on its
      acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy in routine trial clinical
      practice via a two-stage pilot. METHODS: The decision aid was developed according
      to International Patient Decision Aid Standards. Study 1: an initial pilot
      involved 25 members of the consumer advocacy group, Breast Cancer Network
      Australia. Study 2: the main pilot involved 20 women eligible to participate in
      the SNAC-2 trial in New Zealand. In both pilots, a questionnaire assessed:
      information and involvement preferences, decisional conflict, SNAC-2
      trial-related understanding and attitudes, psychological distress, and general
      decision aid feedback. A follow-up telephone interview elicited more detailed
      feedback on the decision aid design and content. RESULTS: In both pilots,
      participants indicated good subjective and objective understanding of SNAC-2
      trial and reported low decisional conflict and anxiety. The decision aid was
      found helpful when deciding about trial participation and provided additional,
      useful information to the standard trial information sheet. CONCLUSION: The
      development and two-stage piloting process for this decision aid resulted in a
      resource that women found very acceptable and helpful in assisting
      decision-making about SNAC-2 trial participation. The process and findings
      provide a guide for developing other trial decision aids.

AB  - The therapeutic goals are palliative for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and
      include prolongation of survival with good quality of life (QoL) and symptom
      control. The purpose of this study was to examine QoL among women with MBC
      treated on KCSG-BR07-02 with maintenance of paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (PG)
      chemotherapy after achieving disease control to initial six cycles of PG
      chemotherapy or observation. Patients were randomized to either maintenance
      chemotherapy or observation until progression. QoL was assessed using EORTC
      QLQ-C30 and BR-23. QoL at each cycle was compared between the two treatment arms 
      using the 2-sample t test. Generalized estimating equation method was used to
      examine the overall difference between the two treatments in QoL. All reported
      p-values are 2 sided. There were no statistically significant differences between
      two arms in most of the component of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR-23 (p > 0.05).
      There was no significant difference between two treatments (p = 0.6094 for
      QLQ-C30, p = 0.5516 for BR23) at baseline, and there did not exist significant
      change over the cycle (p = 0.0914 for QLQ-C30, p = 0.7981 for BR23). There was no
      significant interaction effect between treatment and cycle (p = 0.5543 for
      QLQ-C30. p = 0.5817 for BR23). Maintenance PG chemotherapy in patients with MBC
      achieving disease control with an initial six cycles of PG chemotherapy resulted 
      in better PFS and OS compared to observation without impeding QoL.

TI  - Oncogenic KRAS sensitizes premalignant, but not malignant cells, to
      Noxa-dependent apoptosis through the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway.
PG  - 10994-1008
AB  - KRAS is mutated in about 20-25% of all human cancers and especially in
      pancreatic, lung and colorectal tumors. Oncogenic KRAS stimulates several
      pro-survival pathways, but it also triggers the trans-activation of pro-apoptotic
      genes. In our work, we show that G13D mutations of KRAS activate the MAPK
      pathway, and ERK2, but not ERK1, up-regulates Noxa basal levels. Accordingly,
      premalignant epithelial cells are sensitized to various cytotoxic compounds in a 
      Noxa-dependent manner. In contrast to these findings, colorectal cancer cell
      sensitivity to treatment is independent of KRAS status and Noxa levels are not
      up-regulated in the presence of mutated KRAS despite the fact that ERK2 still
      promotes Noxa expression. We therefore speculated that other survival pathways
      are counteracting the pro-apoptotic effect of mutated KRAS and found that the
      inhibition of AKT restores sensitivity to treatment, especially in presence of
      oncogenic KRAS. In conclusion, our work suggests that the pharmacological
      inhibition of the pathways triggered by mutated KRAS could also switch off its
      oncogene-activated pro-apoptotic stimulation. On the contrary, the combination of
      chemotherapy to inhibitors of specific pro-survival pathways, such as the one
      controlled by AKT, could enhance treatment efficacy by exploiting the pro-death
      stimulation derived by oncogene activation.

TI  - Evaluating breast lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates: a multiparameter
      immunohistochemical study, including assessment of IgG4.

AB  - Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the breast, a modified skin appendage, include
      lymphocytic lobulitis, other nonspecific benign proliferations, and
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma. Distinguishing these
      entities, all of which may be B-cell rich and may have associated sclerosis, can 
      be difficult. In addition, the proportion that represents IgG4-related disease is
      unknown, and the similarity of MALT lymphomas to primary cutaneous marginal zone 
      lymphoma is uncertain. To address these questions, the clinical, histologic, and 
      immunohistochemical features of 50 benign and malignant breast lymphoplasmacytic 
      infiltrates (10 lymphocytic lobulitis, 1 granulomatous, 19 not otherwise
      specified, 20 MALT lymphomas) were evaluated. Compared with the MALT lymphomas,
      benign cases had a less dense infiltrate (P < .001), fewer but more
      histologically apparent germinal centers (P < .001), and more marked fibrosis (P 
      < .0001). Greater than 60% B cells were present in 23% (7/30) benign cases versus
      75% (15/20) MALT lymphomas (P = .0003). Plasma cells were predominantly IgG+ in
      83% (24/29) benign cases and predominantly IgM+ in 73% (14/19) MALT lymphomas (P 
      < .0001). None of the benign cases had greater than 50 IgG4+ plasma
      cells/high-power field, and only 1 lymphocytic lobulitis case had an IgG4/IgG
      ratio exceeding 40% and no clinical evidence for extramammary IgG4-related
      disease. Although there may be some overlapping features, routine histopathology 
      together with limited immunohistochemical stains can distinguish benign from
      neoplastic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the breast. Despite frequent
      sclerosis, the breast is not a common site of unrecognized IgG4-related
      sclerosing disease. Although there are similarities, breast MALT lymphomas can be
      separated from cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma.

TI  - Bilateral Mastectomy versus Breast-Conserving Surgery for Early-Stage Breast
      Cancer: The Role of Breast Reconstruction.
PG  - 1518-26
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although breast-conserving surgery is oncologically safe for women
      with early-stage breast cancer, mastectomy rates are increasing. The objective of
      this study was to examine the role of breast reconstruction in the surgical
      management of unilateral early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: A retrospective
      cohort study of women diagnosed with unilateral early-stage breast cancer (1998
      to 2011) identified in the National Cancer Data Base was conducted. Rates of
      breast-conserving surgery, unilateral and bilateral mastectomy with contralateral
      prophylactic procedures (per 1000 early-stage breast cancer cases) were measured 
      in relation to breast reconstruction. The association between breast
      reconstruction and surgical treatment was evaluated using a multinomial logistic 
      regression, controlling for patient and disease characteristics. RESULTS: A total
      of 1,856,702 patients were included. Mastectomy rates decreased from 459 to 360
      per 1000 from 1998 to 2005 (p < 0.01), increasing to 403 per 1000 in 2011 (p <
      0.01). The mastectomy rates rise after 2005 reflects a 14 percent annual increase
      in contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (p < 0.01), as unilateral mastectomy
      rates did not change significantly. Each percentage point of increase in
      reconstruction rates was associated with a 7 percent increase in the probability 
      of contralateral prophylactic mastectomies, with the greatest variation explained
      by young age(32 percent), breast reconstruction (29 percent), and stage 0 (5
      percent). CONCLUSIONS: Since 2005, an increasing proportion of early-stage breast
      cancer patients have chosen mastectomy instead of breast-conserving surgery. This
      trend reflects a shift toward bilateral mastectomy with contralateral
      prophylactic procedures that may be facilitated by breast reconstruction
      availability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to demonstrate the clinical features and
      management of patients with Ductal Carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM)
      in a single Chinese cancer center. METHODS: Retrospectively analysis of cases
      between 2003 and 2009 was performed in our institution. The type of treatments,
      pathological results, and axillary lymph nodes status, hormonal receptor statues 
      (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2) were collected. The
      disease-free survival rate was calculated from the date of initial diagnosis
      using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty-seven cases were
      enrolled in our study, 474 pure Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 93 DCISM were
      included. Among these, 168 (35.4%) was diagnosed with the grade I and 26(5.5%)
      with grade III in pure DCIS group, compared with 3 (3.2%) and 11(11.8%) with
      grade I and III in DCISM (p < .0001). We also found that DCISM was associated
      with comadonecrosis histologic subtype (p < .0001) and presence of luminal B type
      (ER/PR positive and Her-2 positive) (p < .0032). There were more positive
      axillary lymph nodes involvement in patients with DCISM than those with DCIS
      after performing ALND(p = .0284). Patients with DCISM underwent more axillary
      lymph node dissection (ALND) in Chinese cancer center than those did in US
      centers (1.1% VS 47.8-68% and 86.1% VS 3.6-6.9%, respectively). No significantly 
      difference was found in the overall survival rate between patients with DCIS and 
      DCISM during median 100 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In a Chinese cancer
      hospital, the majority of cases underwent mastectomy and ALDN after the diagnosis
      of DCISM.The optimal treatments of patients with DCISM should be further
      investigated.

AB  - Compared with female breast cancer, male breast cancer is a rare disease, and the
      relationship between clinical/pathologic features and prognosis is controversial,
      or even largely unknown. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis
      using clinical and pathologic data from 109 nonmetastatic operable male breast
      cancer patients treated from January 1996 to December 2011 at Tianjin Medical
      University Cancer Institute and Hospital. Log-rank test showed that lower tumor
      stage, no lymph node involvement, and positive estrogen/progesterone receptor
      status were good predictors of both disease-free survival and overall survival on
      univariate analysis. However, hormonotherapy is only a good predictive factor of 
      disease-free survival, and not of overall survival. In addition, based on a Cox
      proportional hazard regression model, only lymph node involvement, and
      estrogen/progesterone receptor status were statistically significant predictive
      factors on multivariate analysis. Our results demonstrated that although adjuvant
      systemic therapy is used extensively in male breast cancer patients and prognosis
      has improved over the last few decades, lymph node involvement, and
      estrogen/progesterone receptor status are still the most important prognostic
      factors. A prospective multi-center study with a larger sample size is urgently
      needed to further understand male breast cancer.

TI  - Can diet and lifestyle prevent breast cancer: what is the evidence?
PG  - e66-73
LID - 10.14694/EdBook_AM.2015.35.e66 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in both developed and
      less-developed countries. Rates of breast cancer are increasing worldwide, with a
      particular increase in postmenopausal and estrogen receptor-positive cases. The
      World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and American Cancer Society (ACS) cancer
      prevention guidelines recommend maintaining a healthy weight, undertaking at
      least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week, limiting alcohol
      consumption, and eating a plant-based diet. Observational data link adherence to 
      physical activity and alcohol guidelines throughout life to a reduced risk of
      developing pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer. Weight control throughout life 
      appears to prevent cases after menopause. Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern 
      does not have specific effects on breast cancer risk but remains important as it 
      reduces the risk for other common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      diabetes, and dementia. Emerging data suggest that smoking during adolescence or 
      early adulthood increases later risk of breast cancer. Lifestyle factors appear
      to modify risk among high-risk women with a family history and those with typical
      risk of the general population, although their effects among carriers of BRCA
      mutations are not well defined. Recent expert reports estimate that successful
      lifestyle changes could prevent 25% to 30% of cases of breast cancer. These
      reductions will only be achieved if we can implement targeted prevention programs
      for high-risk women and women in population-based breast screening programs
      during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood when the rapidly developing
      breast is particularly susceptible to carcinogenesis.

TI  - Efficacy of SERD/SERM Hybrid-CDK4/6 Inhibitor Combinations in Models of Endocrine
      Therapy-Resistant Breast Cancer.
PG  - 5121-5130
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0360 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Endocrine therapy, using tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, remains
      first-line therapy for the management of estrogen receptor (ESR1)-positive breast
      cancer. However, ESR1 mutations or other ligand-independent ESR1 activation
      mechanisms limit the duration of response. The clinical efficacy of fulvestrant, 
      a selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) that competitively inhibits
      agonist binding to ESR1 and triggers receptor downregulation, has confirmed that 
      ESR1 frequently remains engaged in endocrine therapy-resistant cancers. We
      evaluated the activity of a new class of selective estrogen receptor modulators
      (SERM)/SERD hybrids (SSH) that downregulate ESR1 in relevant models of
      endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Building on the observation that concurrent
      inhibition of ESR1 and the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6)
      significantly increased progression-free survival in advanced patients, we
      explored the activity of different SERD- or SSH-CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations in 
      models of endocrine therapy-resistant ESR1(+) breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      SERDs, SSHs, and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib were evaluated as single agents
      or in combination in established cellular and animal models of endocrine
      therapy-resistant ESR1(+) breast cancer. RESULTS: The combination of palbociclib 
      with a SERD or an SSH was shown to effectively inhibit the growth of MCF7 cell or
      ESR1-mutant patient-derived tumor xenografts. In tamoxifen-resistant MCF7
      xenografts, the palbociclib/SERD or SSH combination resulted in an increased
      duration of response as compared with either drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: A SERD- or 
      SSH-palbociclib combination has therapeutic potential in breast tumors resistant 
      to endocrine therapies or those expressing ESR1 mutations. See related commentary
      by DeMichele and Chodosh, p. 4999.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Screening programs for breast cancer aim to allow early diagnosis, 
      and thus reduce mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a
      population screening program in a sample of women aged between 50 and 69 years in
      terms of recurrence, metastasis, biological profiles, and survival, and to
      compare their results with those of women of a wider age range who did not
      participate on the screening program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective
      multicenter study in which 1821 patients with 1873 breast tumors who received
      surgery between 1999 and 2014 at MutuaTerrassa University Hospital and the
      Hospital of Terrassa in Barcelona were analyzed. A comparison was performed in
      the 50- to 69-year-old age group between those who participated on the screening 
      program and those who did not. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 58 years.
      The mean follow-up was 72 months, and median follow-up 59 months. The screened
      group showed significantly better results in all prognostic factors and in
      specific mortality than all nonscreened groups. The specific mortality rate in
      the screened patients was 2.4% (12/496), local recurrence 2.8% (14/496), and
      metastasis at 10 years 3.6% (18/496). In the nonscreened group, younger women
      presented a higher rate of metastasis (16.4% [81/493]) and a shorter disease-free
      period (77.1% [380/493]). The age group older than 70 years had the highest
      number of T4 tumors (7.5% [30/403]) and the highest proportion of radical surgery
      (50.4% [203/403]). CONCLUSION: Patients in the screening program presented
      improved survival. We speculate that extending breast cancer screening programs
      to women younger than 50 and older than 70 years could bring about mortality
      benefits.

TI  - Fine-needle aspirate CYFRA 21-1, an innovative new marker for diagnosis of
      axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients.
PG  - e811
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000811 [doi]
AB  - To compare the value of cytokeratin fragment 21-1 (CYFRA 21-1) concentration in
      the fine-needle biopsy aspirates (fine needle aspirate [FNA] CYFRA 21-1) with
      cytopathology of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA cytology) and to assess
      whether CYFRA 21-1 concentrations from ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration
      biopsy (US-FNAB) specimens (FNA CYFRA 21-1) is not inferior to FNA cytology in
      the diagnosis of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis of breast cancer
      patients.This study received institutional review board approval, and written
      informed consent was obtained from all patients. US-FNAB was performed in 373
      ALNs from 358 patients with invasive breast cancer. Concentrations of CYFRA 21-1 
      were measured from washouts of the syringe used during US-FNAB (FNA CYFRA 21-1), 
      and ALN metastasis was determined using a cutoff value of 1.93 ng/mL. FNA
      cytology, intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy, and surgical pathology
      results were reviewed and analyzed. The noninferiority margin for the difference 
      in accuracies between FNA cytology and FNA CYFRA 21-1 was set as 5%.Among 373
      ALNs, 136 (36.5%) were benign, and 237 (63.5%) were metastatic. The mean FNA
      CYFRA 21-1 was significantly higher in metastatic ALNs compared to that in benign
      ALNs (P = 0.001). For the diagnosis of ALN metastasis, the sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy
      of FNA CYFRA 21-1 (cutoff value 1.93 ng/mL) were not significantly different from
      those of FNA cytology (P > 0.05). FNA CYFRA 21-1 reached statistical
      noninferiority to FNA cytology in terms of diagnostic accuracy for ALN
      metastasis. Of the 20 ALNs (8 metastasis, 12 benign) that showed insufficient
      results on FNA cytology, FNA CYFRA 21-1 accurately diagnosed 15 ALNs (4
      metastasis, 11 benign).The diagnostic performance of FNA CYFRA 21-1 is comparable
      with that of FNA cytology for breast cancer ALN metastasis. Our results indicate 
      that FNA CYFRA 21-1, using an US-FNAB specimen, can be a useful method equal to
      FNA cytology in terms of diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Efficacy of neoadjuvant bevacizumab added to docetaxel followed by fluorouracil, 
      epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, for women with HER2-negative early breast
      cancer (ARTemis): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ARTemis trial was developed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
      adding bevacizumab to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative early
      breast cancer. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, we
      enrolled women (>/=18 years) with newly diagnosed HER2-negative early invasive
      breast cancer (radiological tumour size >20 mm, with or without axillary
      involvement), at 66 centres in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned via a
      central computerised minimisation procedure to three cycles of docetaxel (100
      mg/m(2) once every 21 days) followed by three cycles of fluorouracil (500
      mg/m(2)), epirubicin (100 mg/m(2)), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2)) once every
      21 days (D-FEC), without or with four cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg)
      (Bev+D-FEC). The primary endpoint was pathological complete response, defined as 
      the absence of invasive disease in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, analysed 
      by intention to treat. The trial has completed and follow-up is ongoing. This
      trial is registered with EudraCT (2008-002322-11), ISRCTN (68502941), and
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01093235). FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2009, and Jan 9, 2013,
      we randomly allocated 800 participants to D-FEC (n=401) and Bev+D-FEC (n=399).
      781 patients were available for the primary endpoint analysis. Significantly more
      patients in the bevacizumab group achieved a pathological complete response
      compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone: 87 (22%, 95% CI 18-27) of
      388 patients in the Bev+D-FEC group compared with 66 (17%, 13-21) of 393 patients
      in the D-FEC group (p=0.03). Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were reported at expected
      levels in both groups, although more patients had grade 4 neutropenia in the
      Bev+D-FEC group than in the D-FEC group (85 [22%] vs 68 [17%]). INTERPRETATION:
      Addition of four cycles of bevacizumab to D-FEC in HER2-negative early breast
      cancer significantly improved pathological complete response. However, whether
      the improvement in pathological complete response will lead to improved
      disease-free and overall survival outcomes is unknown and will be reported after 
      longer follow-up. Meta-analysis of available neoadjuvant trials is likely to be
      the only way to define subgroups of early breast cancer that would have
      clinically significant long-term benefit from bevacizumab treatment. FUNDING:

TI  - Loss of RAB1B promotes triple-negative breast cancer metastasis by activating
      TGF-beta/SMAD signaling.
PG  - 16352-65
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive tumor subtype
      associated with a poor prognosis. The mechanism involved in TNBC progression
      remains largely unknown. To date, there are no effective therapeutic targets for 
      this tumor subtype. In this study, by performing quantitative proteomic analyses 
      in highly metastatic and parental breast cancer cell line, we found that RAB1B, a
      member of the RAS oncogene family, was significantly down-regulated in highly
      metastatic breast cancer cells. Moreover, down-regulation of RAB1B was also found
      to promote the proliferation and migration of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo.
      Mechanistically, loss of RAB1B resulted in elevated expression of TGF-beta
      receptor 1 (TbetaR1) through decreased degradation of ubiquitin, increased levels
      of phosphorylated SMAD3 and TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      (EMT). Furthermore, low RAB1B expression correlated with poor prognosis in breast
      cancer patients. Taken together, our findings reveal that RAB1B acts as a
      metastasis suppressor in TNBC by regulating the TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway
      and RAB1B may serve as a novel biomarker of prognosis and the response to
      anti-tumor therapeutics for patients with TNBC.

TI  - Frequent somatic transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genome of human
      cancer cells.
PG  - 814-24
LID - 10.1101/gr.190470.115 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial genomes are separated from the nuclear genome for most of the cell 
      cycle by the nuclear double membrane, intervening cytoplasm, and the
      mitochondrial double membrane. Despite these physical barriers, we show that
      somatically acquired mitochondrial-nuclear genome fusion sequences are present in
      cancer cells. Most occur in conjunction with intranuclear genomic rearrangements,
      and the features of the fusion fragments indicate that nonhomologous end joining 
      and/or replication-dependent DNA double-strand break repair are the dominant
      mechanisms involved. Remarkably, mitochondrial-nuclear genome fusions occur at a 
      similar rate per base pair of DNA as interchromosomal nuclear rearrangements,
      indicating the presence of a high frequency of contact between mitochondrial and 
      nuclear DNA in some somatic cells. Transmission of mitochondrial DNA to the
      nuclear genome occurs in neoplastically transformed cells, but we do not exclude 
      the possibility that some mitochondrial-nuclear DNA fusions observed in cancer
      occurred years earlier in normal somatic cells.

TI  - CSN6 deregulation impairs genome integrity in a COP1-dependent pathway.
PG  - 11779-93
AB  - Understanding genome integrity and DNA damage response are critical to cancer
      treatment. In this study, we identify CSN6's biological function in regulating
      genome integrity. Constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase 
      regulated by CSN6, is downregulated by DNA damage, but the biological
      consequences of this phenomenon are poorly understood. p27(Kip1) is a critical
      CDK inhibitor involved in cell cycle regulation, but its response to DNA damage
      remains unclear. Here, we report that p27(Kip1) levels are elevated after DNA
      damage, with concurrent reduction of COP1 levels. Mechanistic studies showed that
      during DNA damage response COP1's function as an E3 ligase of p27 is compromised,
      thereby reducing the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p27(Kip1). Also, COP1
      overexpression leads to downregulation of p27(Kip1), thereby promoting the
      expression of mitotic kinase Aurora A. Overexpression of Aurora A correlates with
      poor survival. These findings provide new insight into CSN6-COP1-p27(Kip1)-Aurora
      A axis in DNA damage repair and tumorigenesis.

TI  - Invasive micropapillary mucinous carcinoma of the breast is associated with poor 
      prognosis.
PG  - 443-51

AB  - Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast (IMpC) is a special type of breast
      cancer with frequent lymph node metastasis (LNM) and poor prognosis, while pure
      mucinous carcinoma of breast (PMC) is generally associated with infrequent LNM
      and better prognosis. A similar micropapillary epithelial growth pattern has been
      described in PMC that was named as invasive micropapillary mucinous carcinoma
      (IMpMC), but its prognostic significance is as yet not known. A retrospective
      review of 531 cases of PMC in 43,685 cases of breast cancer diagnosed over a
      10-year period was conducted to assess the frequency of IMpMC and its prognostic 
      implications. IMpMC was identified in 134 (25.2 %) of the 531 PMC cases. Compared
      to conventional PMC (cPMC), IMpMC was found more frequently in younger patients
      and in tumors with increased frequency of LNM and lymphovascular invasion, and
      higher HER2 expression. In stage-matched Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with
      stage II-III IMpMC suffered a decreased overall survival and recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) than matched cPMC patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed the
      presence of IMpMC morphology was an independent unfavorable predictor for LNM and
      RFS of PMC. However, decreased LNM, lower nuclear grade, higher expression of ER 
      and PR, less expression of HER2, and better prognosis were identified in IMpMC
      when compared with IMpC (n = 281). This is the first study to show the prognostic
      significance of IMpMC in a large cohort. IMpMC pursues a more aggressive clinical
      course than cPMC and should be managed differently; therefore, recognition of
      IMpMC and its accurate diagnosis are clinically important.

TI  - Activating PIK3CA Mutations Induce an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
      (EGFR)/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Paracrine Signaling Axis in
      Basal-like Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1959-76
LID - 10.1074/mcp.M115.049783 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110alpha catalytic subunit of
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been shown to transform human mammary
      epithelial cells (MECs). These mutations are present in all breast cancer
      subtypes, including basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Using liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified 72 protein
      expression changes in human basal-like MECs with knock-in E545K or H1047R PIK3CA 
      mutations versus isogenic MECs with wild-type PIK3CA. Several of these were
      secreted proteins, cell surface receptors or ECM interacting molecules and were
      required for growth of PIK3CA mutant cells as well as adjacent cells with
      wild-type PIK3CA. The proteins identified by MS were enriched among human BLBC
      cell lines and pointed to a PI3K-dependent amphiregulin/EGFR/ERK signaling axis
      that is activated in BLBC. Proteins induced by PIK3CA mutations correlated with
      EGFR signaling and reduced relapse-free survival in BLBC. Treatment with EGFR
      inhibitors reduced growth of PIK3CA mutant BLBC cell lines and murine mammary
      tumors driven by a PIK3CA mutant transgene, all together suggesting that PIK3CA
      mutations promote tumor growth in part by inducing protein changes that activate 
      EGFR.

      patients.
PG  - 13579-90
AB  - Liquid biopsies come of age offering unexploited potential to monitor and react
      to tumor evolution. We developed a cost-effective assay to non-invasively
      determine the immune status of glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Employing newly
      developed printed peptide microarrays we assessed the B-cell response against
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in 214 patients. Firstly, sera of long-term (36+
      months, LTS, n=10) and short-term (6-10 months, STS, n=14) surviving patients
      were screened for prognostic antibodies against 1745 13-mer peptides covering
      known TAAs (TNC, EGFR, GLEA2, PHF3, FABP5, MAGEA3). Next, survival associations
      were investigated in two retrospective independent multicenter validation sets
      (n=61, n=129, all IDH1-wildtype). Reliability of measurements was tested using a 
      second array technology (spotted arrays). LTS/STS screening analyses identified
      106 differential antibody responses. Evaluating the Top30 peptides in validation 
      set 1 revealed three prognostic peptides. Prediction of TNC peptide VCEDGFTGPDCAE
      was confirmed in a second set (p=0.043, HR=0.66 [0.44-0.99]) and was unrelated to
      TNC protein expression. Median signals of printed arrays correlated with
      pre-synthesized spotted microarrays (p<0.0002, R=0.33). Multiple survival
      analysis revealed independence of age, gender, KPI and MGMT status. We present a 
      novel peptide microarray immune assay that identified increased anti-TNC
      VCEDGFTGPDCAE serum antibody titer as a promising non-invasive biomarker for
      prolonged survival.

TI  - Tailoring therapies--improving the management of early breast cancer: St Gallen
      International Expert Consensus on the Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer
      2015.
PG  - 1533-46

AB  - The 14th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2015) reviewed
      substantial new evidence on locoregional and systemic therapies for early breast 
      cancer. Further experience has supported the adequacy of tumor margins defined as
      'no ink on invasive tumor or DCIS' and the safety of omitting axillary dissection
      in specific cohorts. Radiotherapy trials support irradiation of regional nodes in
      node-positive disease. Considering subdivisions within luminal disease, the Panel
      was more concerned with indications for the use of specific therapies, rather
      than surrogate identification of intrinsic subtypes as measured by multiparameter
      molecular tests. For the treatment of HER2-positive disease in patients with
      node-negative cancers up to 1 cm, the Panel endorsed a simplified regimen
      comprising paclitaxel and trastuzumab without anthracycline as adjuvant therapy. 
      For premenopausal patients with endocrine responsive disease, the Panel endorsed 
      the role of ovarian function suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane for 
      patients at higher risk. The Panel noted the value of an LHRH agonist given
      during chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER-negative disease in
      protecting against premature ovarian failure and preserving fertility. The Panel 
      noted increasing evidence for the prognostic value of commonly used
      multiparameter molecular markers, some of which also carried prognostic
      information for late relapse. The Panel noted that the results of such tests,
      where available, were frequently used to assist decisions about the inclusion of 
      cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with luminal disease, but
      noted that threshold values had not been established for this purpose for any of 
      these tests. Multiparameter molecular assays are expensive and therefore
      unavailable in much of the world. The majority of new breast cancer cases and
      breast cancer deaths now occur in less developed regions of the world. In these
      areas, less expensive pathology tests may provide valuable information. The Panel
      recommendations on treatment are not intended to apply to all patients, but
      rather to establish norms appropriate for the majority. Again, economic
      considerations may require that less expensive and only marginally less effective
      therapies may be necessary in less resourced areas. Panel recommendations do not 
      imply unanimous agreement among Panel members. Indeed, very few of the 200
      questions received 100% agreement from the Panel. In the text below, wording is
      intended to convey the strength of Panel support for each recommendation, while
      details of Panel voting on each question are available in supplementary Appendix 
      S2, available at Annals of Oncology online.

TI  - Brief cognitive-behavioral and relaxation training interventions for breast
      cancer: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 677-88
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women with breast cancer (BCa) report elevated distress postsurgery.
      Group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) following surgery
      improves psychological adaptation, though its key mechanisms remain speculative. 
      This randomized controlled dismantling trial compared 2 interventions featuring
      elements thought to drive CBSM effects: a 5-week cognitive-behavioral training
      (CBT) and 5-week relaxation training (RT) versus a 5-week health education (HE)
      control group. METHOD: Women with stage 0-III BCa (N = 183) were randomized to
      CBT, RT, or HE condition 2-10 weeks postsurgery. Psychosocial measures were
      collected at baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2). Repeated-measures analyses 
      of variance (ANOVAs) tested whether CBT and RT treatments improved primary
      measures of psychological adaptation and secondary measures of stress management 
      resource perceptions from pre- to postintervention relative to HE. RESULTS: Both 
      CBT and RT groups reported reduced depressive affect. The CBT group reported
      improved emotional well-being/quality of life and less cancer-specific thought
      intrusions. The RT group reported improvements on illness-related social
      disruption. Regarding stress management resources, the CBT group reported
      increased reliability of social support networks, while the RT group reported
      increased confidence in relaxation skills. Psychological adaptation and stress
      management resource constructs were unchanged in the HE control group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Nonmetastatic breast cancer patients participating in 2 forms of
      brief, 5-week group-based stress management intervention after surgery showed
      improvements in psychological adaptation and stress management resources compared
      with an attention-matched control group. Findings provide preliminary support
      suggesting that using brief group-based stress management interventions may
      promote adaptation among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients.

TI  - Identifying clinically relevant prognostic subgroups of postmenopausal women with
      node-positive hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer treated with
      endocrine therapy: a combined analysis of ABCSG-8 and ATAC using the PAM50 risk
      of recurrence score and intrinsic subtype.
PG  - 1685-91
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast
      cancer, variables like tumour size, grade and nodal status have great impact on
      therapy decisions. As most node-positive patients with HR+ breast cancer
      currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy improved methods for characterization of 
      individuals' metastasis risk are needed to reduce overtreatment. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Tissue specimens from node-positive patients of the ABCSG-8 and ATAC
      trials who received adjuvant tamoxifen and/or anastrozole were included in this
      study. Analysing RNA from paraffin blocks using the PAM50 test, the primary
      objective was to evaluate the prognostic information of the risk of recurrence
      (ROR) score added to combined clinical standard variables in patients with one
      positive node (1N+) and in patients with two or three positive nodes (2-3N+),
      using log-likelihood ratio tests. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.6 years,
      distant metastases occurred in 97 (18%) of 543 node-positive patients. In a
      multivariate analysis, the PAM50-derived ROR score provided reliable prognostic
      information in addition to and beyond established clinical factors for 1N+ (P <
      0.0001) and 2-3N+ patients (P = 0.0002). Ten-year distant recurrence risk was
      significantly increased in the high-risk compared with the low-risk group derived
      from ROR score for 1N+ [25.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.5% to 36.1%versus 
      6.6%, 95% CI 3.3% to 12.8%] and compared with the combined low/intermediate risk 
      group for 2-3N+ patients (33.7%, 95% CI 25.5% to 43.8% versus 12.5%, 95% CI 6.6% 
      to 22.8%). Additionally, the luminal A intrinsic subtype (IS) exhibited
      significantly lower risk of distant recurrence compared with the luminal B
      subtype in 1N+ and 2-3N+ patients. CONCLUSION: PAM50 ROR score and IS can
      identify node-positive patient subgroups with limited risk of metastasis after
      endocrine therapy, for whom adjuvant chemotherapy can be spared. The PAM50 test
      is a valuable tool in determining treatment of node-positive early-stage breast
      cancer patients.

TI  - Mammographic density: Comparison of visual assessment with fully automatic
      calculation on a multivendor dataset.
PG  - 175-83
LID - 10.1007/s00330-015-3784-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare breast density (BD) assessment provided by an automated BD
      evaluator (ABDE) with that provided by a panel of experienced breast
      radiologists, on a multivendor dataset. METHODS: Twenty-one radiologists assessed
      613 screening/diagnostic digital mammograms from nine centers and six different
      vendors, using the BI-RADS a, b, c, and d density classification. The same
      mammograms were also evaluated by an ABDE providing the ratio between
      fibroglandular and total breast area on a continuous scale and, automatically,
      the BI-RADS score. A panel majority report (PMR) was used as reference standard. 
      Agreement (kappa) and accuracy (proportion of cases correctly classified) were
      calculated for binary (BI-RADS a-b versus c-d) and 4-class classification.
      RESULTS: While the agreement of individual radiologists with the PMR ranged from 
      kappa = 0.483 to kappa = 0.885, the ABDE correctly classified 563/613 mammograms 
      (92 %). A substantial agreement for binary classification was found for
      individual reader pairs (kappa = 0.620, standard deviation [SD] = 0.140),
      individual versus PMR (kappa = 0.736, SD = 0.117), and individual versus ABDE
      (kappa = 0.674, SD = 0.095). Agreement between ABDE and PMR was almost perfect
      (kappa = 0.831). CONCLUSIONS: The ABDE showed an almost perfect agreement with a 
      21-radiologist panel in binary BD classification on a multivendor dataset,
      earning a chance as a reproducible alternative to visual evaluation. KEY POINTS: 
      Individual BD assessment differs from PMR with kappa as low as 0.483. An ABDE
      correctly classified 92 % of mammograms with almost perfect agreement (kappa =
      0.831). An ABDE can be a valid alternative to subjective BD assessment.

PG  - e662
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000662 [doi]
AB  - Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare type of breast carcinoma. Recurrence
      presenting as chest wall invasion is common but rarely as metastasis to distal
      skeletal muscle in which most patients present with a painful mass. Herein, we
      report a rare case of 65-year-old woman, with MBC and recurrence presenting as
      distal multiple muscle metastasis. The patient received surgical excision for
      symptomatic relief. Unfortunately, she died 12 months postoperatively due to
      disease progression with multiple lung metastasis.In addition to radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy, surgical excision is an alternative option in selected patients
      such as those with painful, isolated, and easily approachable mass.

TI  - Basal and therapy-driven hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha confers resistance to
      endocrine therapy in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
PG  - 8648-62
AB  - Resistance is an obstacle to endocrine therapy for breast cancer. We measured
      levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha in 52 primary breast cancer
      patients before and after receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole 
      for at least 3 months. Pre-treatment levels of HIF-1alpha were associated with
      negative clinical outcome. Furthermore, levels of HIF-1alpha were increased in
      post-treatment residual tumors compared with those in pre-treatment biopsy
      samples. In animal studies, xenografts stably expressing HIF-1alpha were
      resistant to endocrine therapy with fulvestrant compared with the effects in
      control xenografts. Additionally, HIF-1alpha transcription was inhibited by
      zoledronic acid, a conventional drug for the treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis, and was accompanied by a marked inhibition of the RAS/MAPK/ERK1/2
      pathway. HIF-1alpha is a determinant of resistance to endocrine therapy and
      should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming endocrine
      resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. In addition,
      zoledronic acid may overcome endocrine resistance in ER-positive human breast
      cancer by targeting HIF-1alpha transcription through inhibition of the
      RAS/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. Clinical studies on the administration of zoledronic
      acid as a second line treatment in patients who failed endocrine therapy should
      be considered to improve therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Identification of a comprehensive spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary

PG  - e0125571
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0125571 [doi]
AB  - The genetic etiology of hereditary breast cancer has not been fully elucidated.
      Although germline mutations of high-penetrance genes such as BRCA1/2 are
      implicated in development of hereditary breast cancers, at least half of all
      breast cancer families are not linked to these genes. To identify a comprehensive
      spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population,
      we performed an analysis of germline mutations in 2,165 coding exons of 152 genes
      associated with hereditary cancer using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 99
      breast cancer patients from families of cancer patients regardless of cancer
      types. Forty-two deleterious germline mutations were identified in 21 genes of 34
      patients, including 18 (18.2%) BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 3 (3%) TP53 mutations, 5
      (5.1%) DNA mismatch repair gene mutations, 1 (1%) CDH1 mutation, 6 (6.1%) Fanconi
      anemia pathway gene mutations, and 9 (9.1%) mutations in other genes. Of seven
      patients who carried mutations in more than one gene, 4 were BRCA1/2 mutation
      carriers, and their average onset age was much younger than patients with only
      BRCA1/2 mutations. Almost all identified high-penetrance gene mutations in those 
      families fulfill the typical phenotypes of hereditary cancer syndromes listed in 
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, except two TP53 and 
      three mismatch repair gene mutations. Furthermore, functional studies of MSH3
      germline mutations confirmed the association between MSH3 mutation and
      tumorigenesis, and segregation analysis suggested antagonism between BRCA1 and
      MSH3. We also identified a lot of low-penetrance gene mutations. Although the
      clinical significance of those newly identified low-penetrance gene mutations has
      not been fully appreciated yet, these new findings do provide valuable
      epidemiological information for the future studies. Together, these findings
      highlight the importance of genetic testing based on NCCN guidelines and a
      multi-gene analysis using NGS may be a supplement to traditional genetic
      counseling.

AB  - Population-based testing for BRCA1/2 mutations detects a high proportion of
      carriers not identified by cancer family history-based testing. We sought to
      determine whether population-based testing is an effective approach to genetic
      testing in the Bahamas, where 23% of women with breast cancer carry one of seven 
      founder mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. We determined the prevalence of
      founder BRCA mutations in 1847 Bahamian women without a personal history of
      breast or ovarian cancer, unselected for age or family history. We found that
      2.8% (20/705) of unaffected women with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer 
      and 0.09% (1/1089) of unaffected women without a family history carry a BRCA
      mutation. A total of 38% of unaffected women with a known mutation in the family 
      were found to carry the familial mutation. We previously suggested that all
      Bahamian women with breast or ovarian cancer be offered genetic testing. These
      current data suggest that additionally all unaffected Bahamian women with a
      family history of breast/ovarian cancer should be offered genetic testing for the
      founder BRCA mutations.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the effect of preoperative breast MRI on the surgical management
      of ductal carcinoma in situ.
PG  - 883-93
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MRI has been used increasingly in the diagnosis and management of
      women with invasive breast cancer. However, its usefulness in the preoperative
      assessment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains questionable. A
      meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of MRI on surgical treatment
      of DCIS by analysing studies comparing preoperative MRI with conventional
      preoperative assessment. METHODS: Using random-effects modelling, the proportion 
      of women with various outcomes in the MRI versus no-MRI groups was estimated, and
      the odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR (adjusted for study-level median age) for
      each model were calculated. RESULTS: Nine eligible studies were identified that
      included 1077 women with DCIS who had preoperative MRI and 2175 who did not. MRI 
      significantly increased the odds of having initial mastectomy (OR 1.72, P =
      0.012; adjusted OR 1.76, P = 0.010). There were no significant differences in the
      proportion of women with positive margins following breast-conserving surgery
      (BCS) in the MRI and no-MRI groups (OR 0.80, P = 0.059; adjusted OR 1.10, P =
      0.716), nor in the necessity of reoperation for positive margins after BCS (OR
      1.06, P = 0.759; adjusted OR 1.04, P = 0.844). Overall mastectomy rates did not
      differ significantly according to whether or not MRI was performed (OR 1.23, P = 
      0.340; adjusted OR 0.97, P = 0.881). CONCLUSION: Preoperative MRI in women with
      DCIS is not associated with improvement in surgical outcomes.

TI  - iRhoms 1 and 2 are essential upstream regulators of ADAM17-dependent EGFR
      signaling.
PG  - 6080-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1505649112 [doi]
AB  - The metalloproteinase ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) controls EGF 
      receptor (EGFR) signaling by liberating EGFR ligands from their membrane anchor. 
      Consequently, a patient lacking ADAM17 has skin and intestinal barrier defects
      that are likely caused by lack of EGFR signaling, and Adam17(-/-) mice die
      perinatally with open eyes, like Egfr(-/-) mice. A hallmark feature of
      ADAM17-dependent EGFR ligand shedding is that it can be rapidly and
      posttranslationally activated in a manner that requires its transmembrane domain 
      but not its cytoplasmic domain. This suggests that ADAM17 is regulated by other
      integral membrane proteins, although much remains to be learned about the
      underlying mechanism. Recently, inactive Rhomboid 2 (iRhom2), which has seven
      transmembrane domains, emerged as a molecule that controls the maturation and
      function of ADAM17 in myeloid cells. However, iRhom2(-/-) mice appear normal,
      raising questions about how ADAM17 is regulated in other tissues. Here we report 
      that iRhom1/2(-/-) double knockout mice resemble Adam17(-/-) and Egfr(-/-) mice
      in that they die perinatally with open eyes, misshapen heart valves, and growth
      plate defects. Mechanistically, we show lack of mature ADAM17 and strongly
      reduced EGFR phosphorylation in iRhom1/2(-/-) tissues. Finally, we demonstrate
      that iRhom1 is not essential for mouse development but regulates ADAM17
      maturation in the brain, except in microglia, where ADAM17 is controlled by
      iRhom2. These results provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence 
      that a principal function of iRhoms1/2 during mouse development is to regulate
      ADAM17-dependent EGFR signaling, suggesting that iRhoms1/2 could emerge as novel 
      targets for treatment of ADAM17/EGFR-dependent pathologies.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate whether adding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to ultrasound
      (US) and US-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) can reduce the false-negative 
      rate (FNR) in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast
      cancer patients, and to assess false-negative diagnosis of N2 and N3 disease when
      adding MRI to US and US-FNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2012 to February
      2013, 497 breast cancer patients were included in the study. ALNM was evaluated
      according to US and US-FNA prior to MRI. Second-look US was performed when MRI
      showed positive findings of ALNM. If second-look US also revealed a positive
      finding, US-FNA was performed. Diagnostic performance, including FNR, was
      calculated for US and US-FNA with and without MRI. The negative predictive value 
      (NPV) of N2 and N3 disease was evaluated in negative cases based on US and US-FNA
      with MRI. RESULTS: A total of 159 of 497 (32.0%) patients were found to have
      ALNM. Among them, 92 patients were diagnosed with metastasis on US and US-FNA.
      When adding MRI to US and US-FNA, an additional six patients were diagnosed with 
      metastasis. The FNR of diagnosis of ALNM was improved by the addition of MRI
      (42.1% versus 38.4%, p = 0.0143). The NPV for N2 and N3 disease was 98% (391/399)
      based on US and US-FNA with MRI. CONCLUSION: Adding MRI to US and US-FNA could
      reduce the FNR of the diagnosis of ALNM. Furthermore, US and US-FNA with MRI may 
      exclude 98% of N2 and N3 disease.

      Histologies treated included 1005 (73 %) invasive ductal carcinoma and 240 (18 %)
      ductal carcinoma-in situ. T stages were 18 % Tis, 75 % T1, and 8 % >/=T2. Nodal
      status was 73 % N0 and 6 % N1a. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was positive in 83, 70, and 6 %,
      respectively. Cox multivariate analysis for local control was performed using
      histology, age, estrogen receptor status, tumor size, grade, margin, and nodal
      status. RESULTS: The mean (SD) follow-up was 6.9 years (4.3). The 10-year
      actuarial risk (95 % confidence interval) of an ipsilateral breast tumor
      recurrence was 7.6 % (5.6-10.1). Other 10-year actuarial risks (95 % confidence
      interval) were regional failure 2.3 % (1.4-3.7), distant metastasis 3.8 %
      (2.5-5.7), cause-specific survival 96.3 % (94.2-97.6), overall survival 86.5
      (83.0-89.3), and new contralateral cancers 4.6 % (3.0-6.9). On multivariate
      analysis, high grade (hazard ratio 2.81) and positive margin status (hazard ratio
      18.42) were the only two significant variables associated with an increased risk 
      of local recurrence. Physician-reported cosmesis was excellent/good in 84 % (98
      of 116) of patients with >5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest 
      report of outcomes with interstitial breast brachytherapy. This treatment
      resulted in excellent long-term local control and cosmesis outcomes.

PG  - 1751-9
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2015.143 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-20% of all
      breast cancer in women globally. This subtype often has early and high recurrence
      rates resulting in poor survival, partially due to lack of targeted therapies.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify TNBC-specific biomarkers for early
      diagnosis and treatment monitoring, and to develop more effective targeted
      therapy. METHODS: By using miRCURY LNA array platform, we compared the
      differential miRNA expressions in plasma of patient with TNBC (n=5) and non-TNBC 
      (n=5), as well as healthy controls (n=5). Potential miRNAs were then validated in
      a large cohort of patients by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Ten putative miRNAs from
      the microarray data that differentially expressed between non-TNBC and healthy
      controls were identified. In the screening phase (n=90), we selected five miRNAs 
      (miR-92a-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-16, miR-21 and miR-199a-5p) that could discriminate 
      TNBC from non-TNBC for further validation. Results showed that miR-16, miR-21 and
      miR-199a-5p were underexpressed in TNBC when compared with non-TNBC, and were
      further validated in a large cohort (n=252). In addition, post-operative plasma
      levels of miR-16, miR-21 and miR-199a-5p were significantly restored when
      compared with pre-operative plasma of TNBC. Plasma miR-199a-5p expression in TNBC
      had significant difference when compared with non-TNBC and healthy controls, the 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve analysis revealed the highest area under 
      curve (AUC=0.8838) among all. The expression levels were associated with TNM
      stage and tumour subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that miR-199a-5p could
      be a TNBC-specific marker with diagnostic value and provide insights into
      targeted therapy in the treatment of TNBC.

AB  - As breast cancer becomes a chronic condition rather than a life-threatening
      illness, survivors not only have the challenge of dealing with multiple long-term
      side effects of treatment protocols, but may also be forced to address the
      preexisting comorbidities of their therapies, which often include multiple other 
      issues. It is imperative that the information available regarding survivorship
      issues be accessible in an organized and useful format. This article is a modest 
      attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the long-term medical issues.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis by
      recruiting EZH2 and repressing E-cadherin in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 2586-94
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.2976 [doi]
AB  - HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lncRNA),
      functions as a molecular scaffold to link and target the histone modification
      complexes PRC2 and LSD1, then reprograms chromatin states by coupling histone
      H3K27 methylation and H3K4 demethylation for epigenetic gene silencing to promote
      cancer metastasis. It is associated with poor survival in several solid cancers. 
      In this study, we show that HOTAIR expression increased in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma (OSCC) compared with non-tumor tissue and is associated with
      metastasis, the stage and histological differentiation. In addition,
      overexpression of HOTAIR indicated poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free
      survival (DFS) in OSCC patients. Knockdown of HOTAIR by siRNA in OSCC cells
      decreased cell proliferation and colony formation, increased cell invasion and
      migration, and induced apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, significant negative
      correlation between HOTAIR levels and E-cadherin levels was found in OSCC tissues
      and cell lines, and HOTAIR contributed to the regulation of E-cadherin through
      binding to EZH2 and H3K27me3 with the E-cadherin promoter. Our findings suggest
      that HOTAIR expression is associated with OSCC and may be one of critical targets
      in progression and metastasis, and an indicator of poor survival in OSCC.

TI  - Common germline polymorphisms associated with breast cancer-specific survival.
PG  - 58
LID - 10.1186/s13058-015-0570-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have identified common germline variants nominally
      associated with breast cancer survival. These associations have not been widely
      replicated in further studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      association of previously reported SNPs with breast cancer-specific survival
      using data from a pooled analysis of eight breast cancer survival genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS) from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.
      METHODS: A literature review was conducted of all previously published
      associations between common germline variants and three survival outcomes: breast
      cancer-specific survival, overall survival and disease-free survival. All
      associations that reached the nominal significance level of P value <0.05 were
      included. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that had been previously reported as
      nominally associated with at least one survival outcome were evaluated in the
      pooled analysis of over 37,000 breast cancer cases for association with breast
      cancer-specific survival. Previous associations were evaluated using a one-sided 
      test based on the reported direction of effect. RESULTS: Fifty-six variants from 
      45 previous publications were evaluated in the meta-analysis. Fifty-four of these
      were evaluated in the full set of 37,954 breast cancer cases with 2,900 events
      and the two additional variants were evaluated in a reduced sample size of 30,000
      samples in order to ensure independence from the previously published studies.
      Five variants reached nominal significance (P <0.05) in the pooled GWAS data
      compared to 2.8 expected under the null hypothesis. Seven additional variants
      were associated (P <0.05) with ER-positive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although no
      variants reached genome-wide significance (P <5 x 10(-8)), these results suggest 
      that there is some evidence of association between candidate common germline
      variants and breast cancer prognosis. Larger studies from multinational
      collaborations are necessary to increase the power to detect associations,
      between common variants and prognosis, at more stringent significance levels.

LID - 10.2147/IJN.S72263 [doi]
AB  - A purpose of this study was to establish a novel molecular diagnostic model and
      provide new insight into the intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel lymph node
      (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer. A total of 124 breast cancer patients who met 
      the criteria of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and underwent intraoperative
      biopsy were consecutively enrolled in this study. After the SLNs obtained from
      each patient were labeled, MOC-31 monoclonal antibody-mediated immunomagnetic
      separation (IMS) and flow cytometry were used to determine the expressions of
      breast cancer metastasis-related markers, including Mucin 1 (MUC1), CD44v6, and
      HER2. Alternatively, conventional intraoperative hematoxylin and eosin (HE)
      staining and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (CK-IHC) were performed to detect
      potential SLN metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rate
      of the three intraoperative diagnostic methods were compared and analyzed. A
      total of 55 positive-SLNs were found in 38 breast cancer patients using IMS,
      yielding a sensitivity of 86.4% (38/44), specificity of 94.7% (36/38), accuracy
      of 93.5% (116/124), false-positive rate of 2.5% (2/80), false-negative rate of
      13.6% (6/44), positive predictive value of 95.5% (42/44), and negative predictive
      value of 93.0% (80/86). Patients with high expressions of CD44v6, MUC1, and HER2 
      in SLNs tended to have higher number of positive lymph nodes, among which the
      MUC1 and HER2 showed significant differences (P<0.05). Therefore, compared with
      conventional HE staining and CK-IHC, IMS technology has remarkably higher
      sensitivity and specificity and relative lower false-negative rate, thus making
      it an effective and feasible intraoperative detection method of SLN for breast
      cancer diagnosis to some extent.

AB  - PURPOSE: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography
      (CT) improves the anatomical identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SNs). We
      aimed to evaluate the possibility of predicting the SN status using SPECT/CT.
      METHODS: SN mapping using a SPECT/CT system was performed in 381 cases of
      clinically node-negative, operable invasive breast cancer. We evaluated and
      compared the values of SN mapping on SPECT/CT, the findings of other modalities
      and clinicopathological factors in predicting the SN status. RESULTS: Patients
      with SNs located in the Level I area were evaluated. Of the 355 lesions (94.8 %) 
      assessed, six cases (1.6 %) were not detected using any imaging method. According
      to the final histological diagnosis, 298 lesions (78.2 %) were node negative and 
      83 lesions (21.7 %) were node positive. The univariate analysis showed that SN
      status was significantly correlated with the number of SNs detected on SPECT/CT
      in the Level I area (P = 0.0048), total number of SNs detected on SPECT/CT (P =
      0.011), findings of planar lymphoscintigraphy (P = 0.011) and findings of a
      handheld gamma probe during surgery (P = 0.012). According to the multivariate
      analysis, the detection of multiple SNs on SPECT/CT imaging helped to predict SN 
      metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The number of SNs located in the Level I area detected
      using the SPECT/CT system may be a predictive factor for SN metastasis.

TI  - Primary apocrine sweat gland carcinomas of the axilla: a report of two cases and 
      a review of the literature.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/s12957-015-0473-1 [doi]
AB  - Primary apocrine sweat gland carcinoma (PASGC) is an extremely rare malignancy
      with a relatively favorable prognosis. PASGC is often suspected to be a benign
      disease during an initial clinical examination, which leads to inadequate initial
      treatment and extensive metastasis. Owing to the limited number of reports on
      PASGC, its diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines have not yet been
      established. The only known curative therapy for localized PASGC is wide local
      excision. In the present report, we describe two cases of PASGC with locally
      aggressive disease that arose in the axilla and review the literature about its
      clinicopathological features, diagnosis, and treatment. Based on the findings of 
      the current report, we suggest that a sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant
      anti-estrogen therapy should be included in the management of PASGC.

TI  - CD44 increases the efficiency of distant metastasis of breast cancer.
PG  - 11465-76
AB  - Metastasis is the predominant cause of death from cancer yet we have few
      biomarkers to predict patients at increased risk of metastasis and are unable to 
      effectively treat disseminated disease. Analysis of 448 primary breast tumors
      determined that expression of the hylauronan receptor CD44 associated with high
      grade (p = 0.046), ER- (p = 0.001) and PR-negative tumors (p = 0.029), and
      correlated with increased distant recurrence and reduced disease-free survival in
      patients with lymph-node positive or large tumors. To determine its functional
      role in distant metastasis, CD44 was knocked-down in MDA-MB-231 cells using two
      independent shRNA sequences. Loss of CD44 attenuated tumor cell adhesion to
      endothelial cells and reduced cell invasion but did not affect proliferation in
      vitro. To verify the importance of CD44 to post-intravasation events, tumor
      formation was assessed by quantitative in vivo imaging and post-mortem tissue
      analysis following an intra-cardiac injection of transfected cells. CD44
      knock-down increased survival and decreased overall tumor burden at multiple
      sites, including the skeleton in vivo. We conclude that elevated CD44 expression 
      on tumour cells within the systemic circulation increases the efficiency of
      post-intravasation events and distant metastasis in vivo, consistent with its
      association with increased distant recurrence and reduced disease-free survival
      in patients.

TI  - Integrative analyses identify modulators of response to neoadjuvant aromatase
      inhibitors in patients with early breast cancer.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s13058-015-0532-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a vital component of estrogen
      receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer treatment. De novo and acquired resistance,
      however, is common. The aims of this study were to relate patterns of copy number
      aberrations to molecular and proliferative response to AIs, to study differences 
      in the patterns of copy number aberrations between breast cancer samples pre- and
      post-AI neoadjuvant therapy, and to identify putative biomarkers for resistance
      to neoadjuvant AI therapy using an integrative analysis approach. METHODS:
      Samples from 84 patients derived from two neoadjuvant AI therapy trials were
      subjected to copy number profiling by microarray-based comparative genomic
      hybridisation (aCGH, n=84), gene expression profiling (n=47), matched pre- and
      post-AI aCGH (n=19 pairs) and Ki67-based AI-response analysis (n=39). RESULTS:
      Integrative analysis of these datasets identified a set of nine genes that, when 
      amplified, were associated with a poor response to AIs, and were significantly
      overexpressed when amplified, including CHKA, LRP5 and SAPS3. Functional
      validation in vitro, using cell lines with and without amplification of these
      genes (SUM44, MDA-MB134-VI, T47D and MCF7) and a model of acquired AI-resistance 
      (MCF7-LTED) identified CHKA as a gene that when amplified modulates estrogen
      receptor (ER)-driven proliferation, ER/estrogen response element (ERE)
      transactivation, expression of ER-regulated genes and phosphorylation of V-AKT
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a
      rationale for investigation of the role of CHKA in further models of de novo and 
      acquired resistance to AIs, and provide proof of concept that integrative genomic
      analyses can identify biologically relevant modulators of AI response.

AB  - The clinical success of trastuzumab in breast cancer taught us that appropriate
      tumor evaluation is mandatory for the correct identification of patients eligible
      for targeted therapies. Although HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry 
      (IHC) and gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays 
      are routinely used to select patients to receive trastuzumab, both assays only
      partially predict response to the drug. In the case of epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR), the link between the presence of the receptor or its
      amplification and response to anti-EGFR therapies could not be demonstrated. Even
      less is known for HER3 and HER4, mainly due to lack of robust and validated
      assays detecting these proteins. It is becoming evident that, besides FISH and
      IHC, we need better assays to quantify HER receptors and categorize the patients 
      for individualized treatments. Here, we present the current available
      methodologies to measure HER family receptors and discuss the clinical
      implications of target quantification.

TI  - Aurora kinase B is important for antiestrogen resistant cell growth and a
      potential biomarker for tamoxifen resistant breast cancer.
PG  - 239
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1210-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to antiestrogen therapy is a major clinical challenge in
      the treatment of estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive breast cancer. The aim of 
      the study was to explore the growth promoting pathways of antiestrogen resistant 
      breast cancer cells to identify biomarkers and novel treatment targets. METHODS: 
      Antiestrogen sensitive and resistant T47D breast cancer cell lines were used as
      model systems. Parental and fulvestrant resistant cell lines were subjected to a 
      kinase inhibitor library. Kinase inhibitors preferentially targeting growth of
      fulvestrant resistant cells were identified and the growth inhibitory effect
      verified by dose-response cell growth experiments. Protein expression and
      phosphorylation were investigated by western blot analysis. Cell cycle phase
      distribution and cell death were analyzed by flow cytometry. To evaluate Aurora
      kinase B as a biomarker for endocrine resistance, immunohistochemistry was
      performed on archival primary tumor tissue from breast cancer patients who have
      received adjuvant endocrine treatment with tamoxifen. RESULTS: The selective
      Aurora kinase B inhibitor barasertib was identified to preferentially inhibit
      growth of fulvestrant resistant T47D breast cancer cell lines. Compared with
      parental cells, phosphorylation of Aurora kinase B was higher in the fulvestrant 
      resistant T47D cells. Barasertib induced degradation of Aurora kinase B, caused
      mitotic errors, and induced apoptotic cell death as measured by accumulation of
      SubG1 cells and PARP cleavage in the fulvestrant resistant cells. Barasertib also
      exerted preferential growth inhibition of tamoxifen resistant T47D cell lines.
      Finally, high percentage of Aurora kinase B positive tumor cells was
      significantly associated with reduced disease-free and overall survival in 261
      ER-positive breast cancer patients, who have received tamoxifen as first-line
      adjuvant endocrine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Aurora
      kinase B is a driving factor for growth of antiestrogen resistant T47D breast
      cancer cell lines, and a biomarker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen treatment.
      Thus, inhibition of Aurora kinase B, e.g. with the highly selective kinase
      inhibitor barasertib, could be a candidate new treatment for breast cancer
      patients with acquired resistance to antiestrogens.

TI  - BRCA1 Alternative splicing landscape in breast tissue samples.
PG  - 219
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1145-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: BRCA1 is a key protein in cell network, involved in DNA repair
      pathways and cell cycle. Recently, the ENIGMA consortium has reported a high
      number of alternative splicing (AS) events at this locus in blood-derived
      samples. However, BRCA1 splicing pattern in breast tissue samples is unknown.
      Here, we provide an accurate description of BRCA1 splicing events distribution in
      breast tissue samples. METHODS: BRCA1 splicing events were scanned in 70 breast
      tumor samples, 4 breast samples from healthy individuals and in 72 blood-derived 
      samples by capillary electrophoresis (capillary EP). Molecular subtype was
      identified in all tumor samples. Splicing events were considered predominant if
      their relative expression level was at least the 10% of the full-length reference
      signal. RESULTS: 54 BRCA1 AS events were identified, 27 of them were annotated as
      predominant in at least one sample. Delta5q, Delta13, Delta9, Delta5 and 1aA were
      significantly more frequently annotated as predominant in breast tumor samples
      than in blood-derived samples. Predominant splicing events were, on average, more
      frequent in tumor samples than in normal breast tissue samples (P = 0.010).
      Similarly, likely inactivating splicing events (PTC-NMDs, Non-Coding, Delta5 and 
      Delta18) were more frequently annotated as predominant in tumor than in normal
      breast samples (P = 0.020), whereas there were no significant differences for
      other splicing events (No-Fs) frequency distribution between tumor and normal
      breast samples (P = 0.689). CONCLUSIONS: Our results complement recent findings
      by the ENIGMA consortium, demonstrating that BRCA1 AS, despite its tremendous
      complexity, is similar in breast and blood samples, with no evidences for tissue 
      specific AS events. Further on, we conclude that somatic inactivation of BRCA1
      through spliciogenic mutations is, at best, a rare mechanism in breast
      carcinogenesis, albeit our data detects an excess of likely inactivating AS
      events in breast tumor samples.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypercoagulability in malignancy increases the risk of thrombosis, 
      but is also involved in cancer progression. Experimental studies suggest that
      tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) are involved in
      cancer biology as a tumor- promoter and suppressor, respectively, but the
      clinical significance is less clear. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical
      relevance of TF and TFPI genetic and phenotypic diversity in breast cancer.
      METHODS: The relationship between tumor messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and
      plasma levels of TF and TFPI (alpha and beta), tagging single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in F3 (TF) (n=6) and TFPI (n=18), and clinicopathological
      characteristics and molecular tumor subtypes were explored in 152 treatment naive
      breast cancer patients. The effect of tumor expressed TF and TFPIalpha and
      TFPIbeta on survival was investigated in a merged breast cancer dataset of 1881
      patients. RESULTS: Progesterone receptor negative patients had higher mRNA
      expression of total TFPI (alpha+beta) (P=0.021) and TFPIbeta (P=0.014) in tumors.
      TF mRNA expression was decreased in grade 3 tumors (P=0.003). In plasma, total
      TFPI levels were decreased in patients with larger tumors (P=0.013). SNP
      haplotypes of TFPI, but not TF, were associated with specific clinicopathological
      characteristics like tumor size (odds ratio (OR) 3.14, P=0.004), triple
      negativity (OR 2.4, P=0.004), lymph node spread (OR 3.34, P=0.006), and
      basal-like (OR 2.3, P=0.011) and luminal B (OR 3.5, P=0.005) molecular tumor
      subtypes. Increased expression levels of TFPIalpha and TFPIbeta in breast tumors 
      were associated with better outcome in all tumor subtypes combined (P=0.007 and
      P=0.005) and in multiple subgroups, including lymph node positive subjects
      (P=0.006 and P=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that genetic and
      phenotypic variation of both TFPIalpha and TFPIbeta, more than TF, are markers of
      cancer progression. Together with the previously demonstrated tumor suppressor
      effects of TFPI, the beneficial effect of tumor expressed TFPI on survival,
      renders TFPI as a potential anticancer agent, and the clinical significance of
      TFPI in cancer deserves further investigation.

TI  - Idh1 protects murine hepatocytes from endotoxin-induced oxidative stress by
      regulating the intracellular NADP(+)/NADPH ratio.
PG  - 1837-45
LID - 10.1038/cdd.2015.38 [doi]
AB  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (Idh1) is an important metabolic enzyme that produces 
      NADPH by converting isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate. Idh1 is known to reduce
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in cells by treatment with
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Here, we used Idh1-deficient knockout (Idh1
      KO) mice to investigate the role of Idh1 in antioxidant defense in vivo. Idh1 KO 
      mice showed heightened susceptibility to death induced by LPS and exhibited
      increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and interleukin-6. The serum of LPS-injected Idh1 KO mice also
      contained elevated levels of AST, a marker of inflammatory liver damage.
      Furthermore, after LPS injection, livers of Idh1 KO mice showed histological
      evidence of elevated oxidative DNA damage compared with livers of wild-type (WT) 
      mice. Idh1 KO livers showed a faster and more pronounced oxidative stress than WT
      livers. In line with that, Idh1 KO hepatocytes showed higher ROS levels and an
      increase in the NADP(+)/NADPH ratio when compared with hepatocytes isolated from 
      WT mice. These results suggest that Idh1 has a physiological function in
      protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating the intracellular
      NADP(+)/NADPH ratio. Our findings suggest that stimulation of Idh1 activity may
      be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing oxidative stress during
      inflammatory responses, including the early stages of septic shock.

TI  - The implementation of an organised cervical screening programme in Poland: an
      analysis of the adherence to European guidelines.
PG  - 279
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1242-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Well-organised quality-controlled screening can substantially reduce 
      the burden of cervical cancer (CC). European guidelines (EuG) for quality
      assurance in CC screening provide guidance on all aspects of an organised
      screening programme. Organised CC screening in Poland was introduced in 2007. The
      purpose of our study was to analyse: (i) adherence of the programme to EuG; (ii) 
      programme process and performance indicators; (iii) impact of the programme on
      the incidence of and mortality from CC. METHODS: Available data on the policy,
      structure and functioning of the Polish programme were compared with the major
      points of the EuG. Data on the process, and available performance indicators were
      drawn from the screening database and other National Health Fund (NHF) systems.
      Joinpoint regression was used to assess changes in CC incidence and mortality
      trends. RESULTS: The Polish programme adheres partially to EuG in terms of policy
      and organisation. Only a limited set of performance indicators can be calculated 
      due to screening database incompleteness or lack of linkage between existing
      databases. The screening database does not include opportunistic smears collected
      within NHF-reimbursed or private care. The organised programme coverage rate
      fluctuated from 21% to 27% between 2007-2013. In 2012 the coverage reached 35%
      after combining both organised and opportunistic smears reimbursed by the NHF. In
      2012 the number of smears reimbursed by NHF was 60% higher in opportunistic than 
      in organised screening with significant overlap. Data from the private sector are
      not recorded. Depending on years, 30-50% of women referred for colposcopy/biopsy 
      because of abnormal Pap smears were managed within the programme. The
      age-standardised CC incidence and mortality dropped linearly between 1999 and
      2011 without evidence of a period effect. CONCLUSIONS: The Polish organised
      cervical screening programme is only partially adherent to evidence-based EuG.
      Its implementation has not influenced the burden of CC in the country so far.
      Changes with special focus on increasing coverage, development of information
      systems and assessment of quality are required to increase programme adherence to
      EuG and to measure its effectiveness. Our findings may be useful to improve the
      Polish programme and those implemented or planned in other countries.

TI  - Platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of subcutaneous venous access device scars:
      a head-to-head patient survey.
PG  - 630601
LID - 10.1155/2015/630601 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a product widely used in sports
      medicine, tissue repair, and general surgery. A recent meta-analysis showed this 
      product to be beneficial when introduced into a wound area, be it intra-articular
      (i.e., joint-injections) or direct introduction onto the wound surface. METHODS: 
      Between the years of 2012 and 2014 a questionnaire evaluating surgical outcome
      after port (venous access device) removal was answered by 100 patients in the
      control group and 20 patients in a PRP group, leading to a total of 120 patients 
      in this single center, retrospective, subjective outcome evaluation. RESULTS: No 
      statistical difference was shown in postsurgical complication rates, postsurgical
      pain, decreased mobility, and overall quality of life. A significant difference
      was shown in overall patient satisfaction and the desire to further improve port 
      area scarring. Results differed significantly in favor of the PRP group.
      Interestingly, approximately 40.2% of patients are dissatisfied with the surgical
      outcome after port removal in the control group. This result, though surprising, 
      may be improved to 10% dissatisfaction when a PRP product is used. CONCLUSION:
      PRP products such as Arthrex ACP are safe to use and present an additional option
      in improving surgical outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of lymph node ratio (LNR) as compared
      with the number of pN staging in patients with axillary lymph node-positive
      breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of the clinical data of patients who received breast
      conserving surgery and with positive lymph nodes (n = 152) between 1998 and 2007.
      The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared based on 
      the LNR and pN staging. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were classified as pN1
      in 114, pN2 in 23, and pN3 in 15 cases. Among the 152 cases, 114 cases had a LNR 
      </= 0.20, 26 cases had 0.21-0.65, and 12 cases had a LNR>0.65. Univariate
      analysis showed that number of dissected lymph nodes, LNR, pN stage, ER/PR status
      and radiotherapy were significant prognostic factors for DFS and OS (P < 0.05 for
      all). Age and chemotherapy were prognostic factors only for OS (P < 0.05).
      Multivariate analysis indicated that LNR was an independent prognostic factor for
      DFS and OS (P < 0.05 for both). pN stage had no significant effect on DFS or OS
      (P > 0.05 for both). In the pN subgroup analysis, LNR was also showed to be
      significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients. CONCLUSIONS: LNR is
      superior to pN staging as a prognostic factor in axillary lymph node-positive
      breast cancer patients treated by breast conservation surgery, and can be used as
      one of independent prognostic predictors for the patients.

      carcinoma of the breast].
PG  - 37-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, appropriate diagnosis and
      prognosis of spindle cell carcinoma of the breast (SpCC). METHODS:
      Clinicopathological data of 20 patients with histopathologically confirmed breast
      SpCC treated in Tianjin Cancer Hospital from 2004 to 2013 were reviewed
      retrospectively. The survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
      RESULTS: All the patients were female and their median age was 54 years. The
      median maximum diameter of the tumor was 3.8 cm. The misdiagnosis rate was high
      by mammography, B-ultrasound and core needle biopsy (CNB) before operation. So
      that the diagnosis primarily depended on postoperative histopathological
      examination. The positive expression rate of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
      receptor (PR) and human-epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) was low. The
      over-expression rate of Ki-67 was 68.8%. The positive expression rate of EGFR was
      63.6%. The median follow-up time of the 20 patients was 32 months and their
      3-year overall survival rate and 3-year disease-free survival rate were 80.6% and
      57.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Spindle cell carcinoma of the breast is rare
      and has a poor prognosis. The expressions of ER, PR and HER-2 in most samples are
      negative, Ki-67 is overexpressed, and positive rate of EGFR is high. This disease
      is highly invasive, and the best treatment modality is comprehensive therapy
      mainly based on radical resection.

PG  - 260-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis,
      multi-disciplinary therapy and prognosis of accessory breast cancer. METHODS: The
      clinical data were retrospectively analyzed for 22 patients with accessory breast
      cancer from December 2000 and September 2013. RESULTS: Three patients underwent
      breast-conserving local wide excision of tumor plus axillary lymph node
      dissection while the remainder had Auchincloss or Halsted mastectomy. The most
      common histological type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma (n = 16, 72%) and one 
      of them was associated with mucous adenocarcinoma. There were carcinoma simplex
      (n = 1), papillary adenocarcinoma (n = 1) and adenocarcinoma (n = 4). The most
      common pathological stages (according to AJCC Staging of Breast Cancer, 2002, 6th
      edition) were II (n = 15, 68%),I(n = 3), III (n = 4) and IV (n = 0). The median
      follow-up period was 3 (1-14) years. And the follow-up rate was 100%.Until
      October 2014, 2 patients died from metastasis and the remainder survived.
      CONCLUSIONS: Accessory breast cancer is rare and has a worse prognosis.Now the
      clinical diagnostic criteria to it remains controversial and the diagnosis is
      often late. A definite diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical
      characteristics, postoperative pathology and imaging examinations. And surgery
      remains a major option.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between response of primary tumor and
      positive axillary lymph node to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and examine its
      correlation with breast cancer distant disease-free survival (DDFS). METHODS: The
      clinical data of 678 needle biopsy proved node positive breast cancer patients on
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The median
      follow-up period was 45 (6-143) months. The 4-year DDFS in group A (ypT0/is
      ypN0),B (ypT0/is ypN+), C (ypT >/= 1mi ypN0) and D (ypT >/= 1mi ypN+) were 96.4%,
      85.7%, 86.7% and 80.2% respectively. As compared with group A, the relative risk 
      ratios of groups B, C and D were 2.32, 2.09 and 4.07 (P = 0.006).Significant
      difference existed in DDFS between groups A and B (96.4% vs 85.7%, P = 0.045) and
      groups A and C (96.4% vs 86.7%, P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: Pathological response of 
      both primary tumor and positive axillary node are prognostic and crucial for
      evaluating the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

LID - 10.4143/crt.2014.262 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine molecular subtype conversions in
      patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and analyze their clinical 
      implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included consecutive breast cancer
      patients who received NAC at the National Cancer Center, Korea, between August
      2002 and June 2011, and had available data on estrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor
      status prior to NAC. Molecular subtypes, hormone receptor (HR) status, and ER and
      PR Allred scores before and after NAC were compared, and the long-term outcomes
      were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 322 patients, 32 (9.9%) achieved a pathologic complete
      response after NAC. HR+/HER2- tumors tended to convert into triple negative (TN) 
      tumors (10.3%), whereas 34.6% of TN tumors gained HR positivity to become
      HR+/HER2- tumors. Clinical outcomes of molecular subtype conversion groups were
      compared against patients who remained as HR+/HER2- throughout. The HR+/HER2- to 
      TN group had significantly poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio,
      3.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 7.85) and overall survival (OS)
      (hazard ratio, 3.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 10.38). Patients who remained TN throughout 
      had the worst outcomes (for RFS: hazard ratio, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.86 to 7.36; for
      OS: hazard ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 2.53 to 13.51), while those who converted from TN
      to HR+/HER2-showed improved comparable survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: Molecular
      subtypes of breast cancers changed frequently after NAC, resulting in different
      tumor prognostication. Tumor subtyping should be repeated after NAC in patients
      with breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 
      10 (PTEN) might be an important tool in identifying human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients unlikely to derive benefit from
      anti-HER2 therapies. However, studies to date have failed to demonstrate its
      predictive role in any treatment setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively
      collected baseline core biopsies from 429 early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer
      patients treated with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or their combination in the
      Neo-ALTTO study were stained using two anti-PTEN monoclonal antibodies (CST and
      DAKO). The association of PTEN status and PI3K pathway activation (defined as
      either PTEN loss and/or PIK3CA mutation) with total pathological complete
      response (tpCR) at surgery, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) 
      was evaluated. RESULTS: PTEN loss was observed in 27% and 29% of patients (all
      arms, n = 361 and n = 363) for CST and DAKO, respectively. PTEN loss was more
      frequently observed in hormone receptor (HR)-negative (33% and 36% with CST and
      DAKO, respectively) compared with HR-positive tumours (20% and 22% with CST and
      DAKO, respectively). No significant differences in tpCR rates were observed
      according to PTEN status. PI3K pathway activation was found in 47% and 48% of
      patients (all arms, n = 302 and n = 301) for CST and DAKO, respectively.
      Similarly, tpCR rates were not significantly different for those with or without 
      PI3K pathway activation. Neither PTEN status nor PI3K pathway activation were
      predictive of tpCR, EFS, or OS, independently of treatment arm or HR status. High
      inter-antibody and inter-observer agreements were found (>90%). Modification of
      scoring variables significantly affected the correlation between PTEN and HR
      status but not with tpCR. CONCLUSION: These data show that PTEN status
      determination is not a useful biomarker to predict resistance to trastuzumab and 
      lapatinib-based therapies. The lack of standardization of PTEN status
      determination may influence correlations between expression and relevant clinical
      end points. CLINICAL TRIALS: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov:
      NCT00553358.

TI  - Uncovering the genomic heterogeneity of multifocal breast cancer.
PG  - 457-66

AB  - Multifocal breast cancer (MFBC), defined as multiple synchronous unilateral
      lesions of invasive breast cancer, is relatively frequent and has been associated
      with more aggressive features than unifocal cancer. Here, we aimed to investigate
      the genomic heterogeneity between MFBC lesions sharing similar histopathological 
      parameters. Characterization of different lesions from 36 patients with ductal
      MFBC involved the identification of non-silent coding mutations in 360
      protein-coding genes (171 tumour and 36 matched normal samples). We selected only
      patients with lesions presenting the same grade, ER, and HER2 status. Mutations
      were classified as 'oncogenic' in the case of recurrent substitutions reported in
      COSMIC or truncating mutations affecting tumour suppressor genes. All mutations
      identified in a given patient were further interrogated in all samples from that 
      patient through deep resequencing using an orthogonal platform. Whole-genome
      rearrangement screen was further conducted in 8/36 patients. Twenty-four patients
      (67%) had substitutions/indels shared by all their lesions, of which 11 carried
      the same mutations in all lesions, and 13 had lesions with both common and
      private mutations. Three-quarters of those 24 patients shared oncogenic variants.
      The remaining 12 patients (33%) did not share any substitution/indels, with
      inter-lesion heterogeneity observed for oncogenic mutation(s) in genes such as
      PIK3CA, TP53, GATA3, and PTEN. Genomically heterogeneous lesions tended to be
      further apart in the mammary gland than homogeneous lesions. Genome-wide analyses
      of a limited number of patients identified a common somatic background in all
      studied MFBCs, including those with no mutation in common between the lesions. To
      conclude, as the number of molecular targeted therapies increases and trials
      driven by genomic screening are ongoing, our findings highlight the presence of
      genomic inter-lesion heterogeneity in one-third, despite similar pathological
      features. This implies that deeper molecular characterization of all MFBC lesions
      is warranted for the adequate management of those cancers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Indigenous Maori women have a 60% higher breast cancer mortality
      rate compared with European women in New Zealand. We investigated differences in 
      cancer biological characteristics and their impact on breast cancer mortality
      disparity between Maori and NZ European women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on
      2849 women with primary invasive breast cancers diagnosed between 1999 and 2012
      were extracted from the Waikato Breast Cancer Register. Differences in
      distribution of cancer biological characteristics between Maori and NZ European
      women were explored adjusting for age and socioeconomic deprivation in logistic
      regression models. Impacts of socioeconomic deprivation, stage and cancer
      biological characteristics on breast cancer mortality disparity between Maori and
      NZ European women were explored in Cox regression models. RESULTS: Compared with 
      NZ European women (n=2304), Maori women (n=429) had significantly higher rates of
      advanced and higher grade cancers. Maori women also had non-significantly higher 
      rates of ER/PR negative and HER-2 positive breast cancers. Higher odds of
      advanced stage and higher grade remained significant for Maori after adjusting
      for age and deprivation. Maori women had almost a 100% higher age and deprivation
      adjusted breast cancer mortality hazard compared with NZ European women (HR=1.98,
      1.55-2.54). Advanced stage and lower proportion of screen detected cancer in
      Maori explained a greater portion of the excess breast cancer mortality (HR
      reduction from 1.98 to 1.38), while the additional contribution through
      biological differences were minimal (HR reduction from 1.38 to 1.35).
      CONCLUSIONS: More advanced cancer stage at diagnosis has the greatest impact
      while differences in biological characteristics appear to be a minor contributor 
      for inequities in breast cancer mortality between Maori and NZ European women.
      Strategies aimed at reducing breast cancer mortality in Maori should focus on
      earlier diagnosis, which will likely have a greater impact on reducing breast
      cancer mortality inequity between Maori and NZ European women.

AB  - This study aims to investigate clinical significance of topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) 
      expression and TOP2A gene change in operable invasive breast cancer. This is a
      retrospective analysis, which includes 256 patients diagnosed as operable
      invasive breast cancer. All postoperational waxed specimens were subjected to
      resectioning for staining. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), KI-67, TOP2A expression, and
      TOP2A gene changes were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in
      situ hybridization technique (FISH), respectively. Correlation between TOP2A
      expression and clinicopathological characteristics was also investigated. Effects
      of TOP2A protein or gene changes on survival rate were detected. Results
      indicated that 165 were TOP2A positive (64.5 %), and 31 were gene amplification
      positive (12.1 %). Positive rate of TOP2A expression showed significant
      correlations with ER, KI-67, and HER-2. The difference of 5-year overall survival
      (OS) between TOP2A-positive and TOP2A-negative groups did not reach statistical
      significance (OS: P = 0.321, 85.9 vs. 79.6 %; disease-free survival [DFS]: P =
      0.247, 83.3 vs. 75.3 %). Five-year OS in TOP2A amplification group was 68.8 %,
      which is lower than deficiency and control group (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis
      showed no significant differences of OS and DFS either between TOP2A-positive and
      TOP2A-negative groups or between TOP2A amplification and control group in
      population of patients with HER-2 amplification, triple negative breast cancer,

      expression correlates significantly with ER, KI-67, and HER-2. However,
      prognostic significance of either TOP2A expression or TOP2A gene changes in
      breast cancer and its various subtypes is limited.

TI  - MiR-195 suppresses non-small cell lung cancer by targeting CHEK1.
PG  - 9445-56
AB  - MiR-195 suppresses tumor growth and is associated with better survival outcomes
      in several malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our
      previous study showed high miR-195 plasma levels associated with favorable
      overall survival of non-smoking women with lung adenocarcinoma. To further
      elucidate role of miR-195 in NSCLC, we conducted in vitro experiment as well as
      clinical studies in a cohort of 299 NSCLC samples. We demonstrated that miR-195
      expression was lower in tumor tissues and was associated with poor survival
      outcome. Overexpression of miR-195 suppressed tumor cell growth, migration and
      invasion. We discovered that CHEK1 was a direct target of miR-195, which
      decreased CHEK1 expression in lung cancer cells. High expression of CHEK1 in lung
      tumors was associated with poor overall survival. Our results suggest that
      miR-195 suppresses NSCLC and predicts lung cancer prognosis.

TI  - Loss of TGFbeta Receptor Type 2 Expression Impairs Estrogen Response and Confers 
      Tamoxifen Resistance.
PG  - 1457-69
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1583 [doi]
AB  - One third of the patients with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive breast 
      cancer who are treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen will either not respond to
      initial therapy or will develop drug resistance. Endocrine response involves
      crosstalk between ERalpha and TGFbeta signaling, such that tamoxifen
      nonresponsiveness or resistance in breast cancer might involve aberrant TGFbeta
      signaling. In this study, we analyzed TGFbeta receptor type 2 (TGFBR2) expression
      and correlated it with ERalpha status and phosphorylation in a cohort of 564
      patients who had been randomized to tamoxifen or no-adjuvant treatment for
      invasive breast carcinoma. We also evaluated an additional four independent
      genetic datasets in invasive breast cancer. In all the cohorts we analyzed, we
      documented an association of low TGFBR2 protein and mRNA expression with
      tamoxifen resistance. Functional investigations confirmed that cell cycle or
      apoptosis responses to estrogen or tamoxifen in ERalpha-positive breast cancer
      cells were impaired by TGFBR2 silencing, as was ERalpha phosphorylation,
      tamoxifen-induced transcriptional activation of TGFbeta, and upregulation of the 
      multidrug resistance protein ABCG2. Acquisition of low TGFBR2 expression as a
      contributing factor to endocrine resistance was validated prospectively in a
      tamoxifen-resistant cell line generated by long-term drug treatment.
      Collectively, our results established a central contribution of TGFbeta signaling
      in endocrine resistance in breast cancer and offered evidence that TGFBR2 can
      serve as an independent biomarker to predict treatment outcomes in
      ERalpha-positive forms of this disease.

TI  - High-density and very-low-density lipoprotein have opposing roles in regulating
      tumor-initiating cells and sensitivity to radiation in inflammatory breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1072-80

AB  - PURPOSE: We previously demonstrated that cholesterol-lowering agents regulate
      radiation sensitivity of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cell lines in vitro and
      are associated with less radiation resistance among IBC patients who undergo
      postmastectomy radiation. We hypothesized that decreasing IBC cellular
      cholesterol induced by treatment with lipoproteins would increase radiation
      sensitivity. Here, we examined the impact of specific transporters of cholesterol
      (ie lipoproteins) on the responses of IBC cells to self-renewal and to radiation 
      in vitro and on clinical outcomes in IBC patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two
      patient-derived IBC cell lines, SUM 149 and KPL4, were incubated with low-density
      lipoproteins (LDL), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), or high-density
      lipoproteins (HDL) for 24 hours prior to irradiation (0-6 Gy) and mammosphere
      formation assay. Cholesterol panels were examined in a cohort of patients with
      primary IBC diagnosed between 1995 and 2011 at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
      Lipoprotein levels were then correlated to patient outcome, using the log rank
      statistical model, and examined in multivariate analysis using Cox regression.
      RESULTS: VLDL increased and HDL decreased mammosphere formation compared to
      untreated SUM 149 and KPL4 cells. Survival curves showed enhancement of survival 
      in both of the IBC cell lines when pretreated with VLDL and, conversely,
      radiation sensitization in all cell lines when pretreated with HDL. In IBC
      patients, higher VLDL values (>30 mg/dL) predicted a lower 5-year overall
      survival rate than normal values (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.9 [95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 1.05-3.45], P=.035). Lower-than-normal patient HDL values (<60
      mg/dL) predicted a lower 5-year overall survival rate than values higher than 60 
      mg/dL (HR = 3.21 [95% CI: 1.25-8.27], P=.015). CONCLUSIONS: This study discovered
      a relationship among the plasma levels of lipoproteins, overall patient response,
      and radiation resistance in IBC patients and IBC patient-derived cell lines. A
      more expansive study is needed to verify these observations.

TI  - Expression and clinicopathological significance of FSIP1 in breast cancer.
PG  - 10658-66
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinicopathological significance of the expression of
      fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) in breast cancer, serum samples, and
      wound fluid from patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Wound fluid and serum
      samples from female patients with primary breast cancer, recurrent and metastatic
      breast cancer, and benign tumors were analyzed for FSIP1 expression using ELISA. 
      286 paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from breast cancer patients with at
      least 5 years of follow-up were included for FSIP1 expression assay using
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Expression of FSIP1 protein was significantly
      higher in breast cancer tissues compared to tumor-adjacent tissues (p = 0.001).
      Strong correlation was observed between FSIP1 expression and human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) or Ki67 expression in breast cancer (p = 0.027
      and 0.002, respectively). Similarly, serum level of FSIP1 was higher in patients 
      with recurrent and metastatic breast cancer compared to that of primary breast
      cancer (7, 713 +/- 3, 065 vs. 4, 713 +/- 3, 065 pg/ml, p = 0.003). Finally,
      patients with high FSIP1 expression showed a worse post-operative
      disease-specific survival (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: FSIP1 may play an important
      role in the tumorigenesis and invasion of breast cancer and is a potential
      biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis or prognosis.

TI  - Evaluation of factors impacting cosmetic outcome of breast conservative
      surgery--a study in Iran.
PG  - 2203-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast conservative surgery (BCS) followed by radiotherapy is the
      standard approach in management of stage I-II breast cancer. Several factors can 
      affect cosmetic outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cosmetic
      results of BCS and influencing factors in the Iranian Breast Cancer Research
      Center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had undergone BCS were included.
      Photographs were taken of both breasts of the patients in three aspects and were 
      evaluated by three specialists. The cosmetic scores were calculated based on a
      standard questionnaire. The data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate 
      regression for relationships between cosmetic scores and clinical data. RESULTS: 
      A total number of 103 patients were included in the study. Mean age and BMI of
      the patients were 46.8+/-8.9 and 28.1+/-3.9, respectively. Breast cup sizes C and
      D accounted for 74.7% of the study group. The mean cosmetic score obtained from
      three referees was 5.72+2.06, consisting of 35.9% excellent-good, 35% moderate,
      and 29.1% unsatisfactory results. Patient BMI, volume of the resected tissue and 
      breast cup size (D) showed significant correlation with the cosmetic score. On
      multivariate regression analysis, cosmetic score and BMI (p=0.022,) as well as
      breast cup size (p=0.040), remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate or
      delayed symmetrization of the breasts is suggested during breast conservative
      surgery, meanwhile performing oncoplastic techniques to improve the results
      significantly. Also it is suggested to discuss anticipation of less satisfactory 
      results with patients having higher BMI and large breast cup size.

TI  - The SNP rs6500843 in 16p13.3 is associated with survival specifically among
      chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients.
PG  - 7390-407
AB  - We have utilized a two-stage study design to search for SNPs associated with the 
      survival of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Our
      initial GWS data set consisted of 805 Finnish breast cancer cases (360 treated
      with adjuvant chemotherapy). The top 39 SNPs from this stage were analyzed in
      three independent data sets: iCOGS (n=6720 chemotherapy-treated cases), SUCCESS-A
      (n=3596), and POSH (n=518). Two SNPs were successfully validated: rs6500843 (any 
      chemotherapy; per-allele HR 1.16, 95% C.I. 1.08-1.26, p=0.0001,
      p(adjusted)=0.0091), and rs11155012 (anthracycline therapy; per-allele HR 1.21,
      95% C.I. 1.08-1.35, p=0.0010, p(adjusted)=0.0270). The SNP rs6500843 was found to
      specifically interact with adjuvant chemotherapy, independently of standard
      prognostic markers (p(interaction)=0.0009), with the rs6500843-GG genotype
      corresponding to the highest hazard among chemotherapy-treated cases (HR 1.47,
      95% C.I. 1.20-1.80). Upon trans-eQTL analysis of public microarray data, the
      rs6500843 locus was found to associate with the expression of a group of genes
      involved in cell cycle control, notably AURKA, the expression of which also
      exhibited differential prognostic value between chemotherapy-treated and
      untreated cases in our analysis of microarray data. Based on previously published
      information, we propose that the eQTL genes may be connected to the rs6500843
      locus via a RBFOX1-FOXM1 -mediated regulatory pathway.

AB  - Accurate identification of factors associated with progression of colorectal
      cancer remains a challenge. In particular, it is unclear which statistical
      methods are most suitable to separate the effects of putative prognostic factors 
      on cancer progression vs cancer-specific and other cause mortality. To address
      these challenges, we analyzed 10 year follow-up data for patients who underwent
      curative surgery for colorectal cancer in 1985-2000. Separate analyses were
      performed in two French cancer registries. Results of three multivariable models 
      were compared: Cox model with recurrence as a time-dependent variable, and two
      multi-state models, which separated prognostic factor effects on recurrence vs
      death, with or without recurrence. Conventional multi-state model analyzed
      all-cause mortality while new relative survival multi-state model focused on
      cancer-specific mortality. Among the 2517 and 2677 patients in the two
      registries, about 50% died without a recurrence, and 28% had a recurrence, of
      whom almost 90% died. In both multi-state models men had significantly increased 
      risk of cancer recurrence in both registries (HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.68-0.92 and
      HR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.96). However, the two multi-state models identified
      different prognostic factors for mortality without recurrence. In contrast to the
      conventional model, in the relative survival analyses gender had no independent
      association with cancer-specific mortality whereas patients diagnosed with stage 
      III cancer had significantly higher risks in both registries (HR=1.67; 95% CI:
      1.27-2.22 and HR=2.38; 95% CI: 1.29-3.27). In conclusion, relative survival
      multi-state model revealed that different factors may be associated with cancer
      recurrence vs cancer-specific mortality either after or without a recurrence.

AB  - Current bio-medical imaging researches aim to detect brain micrometastasis in
      early stage for its increasing incidence and high mortality rates. Synchrotron
      phase-contrast imaging techniques, such as in-line phase-contrast (IPC) and
      grating-based phase-contrast (GPC) imaging, could provide a high spatial and
      density imaging study of biological specimens' 3D structures. In this study, we
      demonstrated the detection efficiencies of these two imaging tools on breast
      cancer micrometastasis in an ex vivo mouse brain. We found that both IPC and GPC 
      can differentiate abnormal brain structures induced by micrometastasis from the
      surrounding normal tissues. We also found that GPC was more sensitive in
      detecting the small metastasis as compared to IPC.

TI  - Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and risk of breast cancer: a nested case-control
      study using multiple time points.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djv032 [doi]
LID - djv032 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence that breast cancer risk is influenced by
      environmental factors. Blood lipid and lipoprotein levels are also influenced by 
      environmental factors and are associated with some breast cancer risk factors. We
      examined whether serial measures of serum lipids and lipoproteins were associated
      with breast cancer risk. METHODS: We carried out a nested case-control study
      within a randomized long-term dietary intervention trial with 4690 women with
      extensive mammographic density followed for an average of 10 years for breast
      cancer incidence. We measured lipids in an average of 4.2 blood samples for 279
      invasive breast cancer case subjects and 558 matched control subjects. We
      calculated subaverages of lipids for each subject based on menopausal status and 
      use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at blood collection and analyzed their
      association with breast cancer using generalized estimating equations. All
      statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
      (HDL-C) (P = .05) and apoA1 (P = .02) levels were positively associated with
      breast cancer risk (75(th) vs 25(th) percentile: HDL-C, 23% higher; apoA1, 28%
      higher) and non-HDL-C (P = .03) and apoB (P = .01) levels were negatively
      associated (75(th) vs 25(th) percentile: non-HDL-C, 19% lower; apoB, 22% lower). 
      These associations were observed only when lipids were measured when HRT was not 
      used. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not statistically
      significantly associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      demonstrate that serum lipids are associated with breast cancer risk in women
      with extensive mammographic density. The possibility that interventions for heart
      disease prevention, which aim to reduce non-HDL-C or raise HDL-C, may have
      effects on breast cancer risk merits examination.

AB  - The effect of disease-specific cognitions on interest in clinic-based and
      direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing was assessed. Participants (N = 309)
      responded to an online hypothetical scenario and received genetic testing-related
      messages that varied by risk probability (25, 50, 75 %) and disease type
      (Alzheimer's disease vs. Type 2 Diabetes). Post-manipulation interest increased
      for both testing types, but was greater for clinic-based testing. Interest was
      greater for Type 2 Diabetes than for Alzheimer's disease, the latter perceived as
      more severe and likely, and less treatable and preventable. For DTC testing only,
      participants allocated to the high risk condition (75 %) had greater testing
      interest than those in the low (25 %) category. DTC testing is perceived as a
      viable, but less preferred, option compared with clinic-based testing.
      Particularly when considering DTC genetic testing, there is a need to emphasize
      subjective disease-related perceptions, including risk probability.

AB  - This study involved developing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for
      discriminating the grades of breast cancer tumors in ultrasound (US) images.
      Histological tumor grades of breast cancer lesions are standard prognostic
      indicators. Tumor grade information enables physicians to determine appropriate
      treatments for their patients. US imaging is a noninvasive approach to breast
      cancer examination. In this study, 148 3-dimensional US images of malignant
      breast tumors were obtained. Textural, morphological, ellipsoid fitting, and
      posterior acoustic features were quantified to characterize the tumor masses. A
      support vector machine was developed to classify breast tumor grades as either
      low or high. The proposed CAD system achieved an accuracy of 85.14% (126/148), a 
      sensitivity of 79.31% (23/29), a specificity of 86.55% (103/119), and an A Z of
      0.7940.

      conflicting. In addition, the prognostic effect of molecular subtypes on ILC
      remains unclear. In this study, the clinicopathological and prognostic data
      between 269 ILC and 816 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases in a Chinese
      population were extensively compared, with a median follow-up time of 7.8 years. 
      Compared with the IDC group, ILC tumors had more lymph node invasion, hormonal
      receptor positivity, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
      negativity. ILC patients showed overall survival (OS) and
      recurrence/metastasis-free survival (RFS) rates similar to those of IDC patients 
      but exhibited worse disease-free survival (DFS) rate because of the higher rate
      of contralateral breast cancer (BC). Further analysis showed that OS, RFS, and
      DFS were similar between ILC and IDC patients in the subgroups of luminal A and
      triple-negative BC with HER2 negativity but were worse in ILC patients than those
      in IDC patients in the subgroups of luminal B and HER2 overexpression with
      positive HER2 expression. Multivariate analysis indicated HER2 positivity as an
      independent risk factor for OS, RFS, and DFS of ILC patients, which increased the
      risk in the ILC group than that in IDC group. The interaction of HER2 and ILC was
      also defined as an independent risk factor for OS, RFS, and DFS of the entire
      population. In conclusion, overexpression of HER2 exhibited stronger negative
      effect on the prognosis of ILC patients than that in IDC patients, suggesting
      that treatment targeting HER2 is crucial for this BC subgroup.

      (IBC): prevalence, clinicopathologic features and prognostic implication.
PG  - e0120320

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most aggressive form of
      breast cancer, and its molecular pathogenesis still remains to be elucidated.
      This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and implication of anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) copy number change in IBC patients. METHODS: We
      retrospectively collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues and
      medical records of IBC patients from several institutes in Korea. ALK gene copy
      number change and rearrangement were assessed by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) assay, and ALK expression status was evaluated by
      immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. RESULTS: Thirty-six IBC patients including
      those with HER2 (+) breast cancer (16/36, 44.4%) and triple-negative breast
      cancer (13/36, 36.1%) were enrolled in this study. ALK copy number gain (CNG) was
      observed in 47.2% (17/36) of patients, including one patient who harbored ALK
      gene amplification. ALK CNG (+) patients showed significantly worse overall
      survival compared to ALK CNG (-) patients in univariate analysis (24.9 months vs.
      38.1 months, p = 0.033). Recurrence free survival (RFS) after curative mastectomy
      was also significantly shorter in ALK CNG (+) patients than in ALK CNG (-)
      patients (n = 22, 12.7 months vs. 43.3 months, p = 0.016). Multivariate Cox
      regression analysis with adjustment for HER2 and ER statuses showed significantly
      poorer RFS for ALK CNG (+) patients (HR 5.63, 95% CI 1.11-28.44, p = 0.037).
      CONCLUSION: This study shows a significant presence of ALK CNG in IBC patients,
      and ALK CNG was associated with significantly poorer RFS.

TI  - Clinicopathologic characteristics and molecular subtypes of microinvasive
      carcinoma of the breast.
PG  - 2241-8
LID - 10.1007/s13277-014-2652-z [doi]
AB  - Patients with microinvasive carcinoma often have favorable prognosis, but it
      remains unclear whether this special type of breast cancer represents a distinct 
      morphological entity with its own biological features and clinical behavior
      distinct from those of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study is a
      retrospective analysis of a large patient cohort from a single institution. One
      hundred and thirty one microinvasive carcinoma and 451 DCIS cases were collected.
      ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 were examined by immunohistochemistry in pathological
      sections. We assessed the clinicopathologic characteristics, molecular features, 
      and survival status of microinvasive carcinoma and compared to those of DCIS.
      Microinvasive carcinoma differed from DCIS with respect to tumor size, lymph node
      status, and initial presentation (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference
      in nuclear grade among microinvasive carcinoma of different molecular subtype (P 
      < 0.05). The clinicalpathologic features and outcomes of patients with
      microinvasive carcinoma were similar to those with DCIS. The 5-year OS rate for
      microinvasive carcinoma and DCIS patients was 99.0 and 99.2%, respectively. A
      combination of pathologic, clinical, and molecular factors may ultimately reveal 
      more powerful and robust measures for disease classification than any one
      modality alone. Microinvasive carcinoma does not significantly predict for worse 
      DFS or OS in comparison with patients with DCIS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Platinum chemotherapy has a role in the treatment of metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer but its full potential has probably not yet been
      reached. We assessed whether a cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen was
      non-inferior to or superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as first-line therapy 
      for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. METHODS: For this
      open-label, randomised, phase 3, hybrid-designed trial undertaken at 12
      institutions or hospitals in China, we included Chinese patients aged 18-70 years
      with previously untreated, histologically confirmed metastatic triple-negative
      breast cancer, and an ECOG performance status of 0-1. These patients were
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either cisplatin plus gemcitabine (cisplatin
      75 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8) or paclitaxel
      plus gemcitabine (paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) on
      days 1 and 8) given intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of eight cycles.
      Randomisation was done centrally via an interactive web response system using
      block randomisation with a size of eight, with no stratification factors.
      Patients and investigator were aware of group assignments. The primary endpoint
      was progression-free survival and analyses were based on all patients who
      received at least one dose of assigned treatment. The margin used to establish
      non-inferiority was 1.2. If non-inferiority of cisplatin plus gemcitabine
      compared with paclitaxel plus gemcitabine was achieved, we would then test for
      superiority. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01287624.
      FINDINGS: From Jan 14, 2011, to Nov 14, 2013, 240 patients were assessed for
      eligibility and randomly assigned to treatment (120 in the cisplatin plus
      gemcitabine group and 120 in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group). 236 patients
      received at least one dose of assigned chemotherapy and were included in the
      modified intention-to-treat analysis (118 per group). After a median follow-up of
      16.3 months (IQR 14.4-26.8) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 15.9
      months (10.7-25.4) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group, the hazard ratio for
      progression-free survival was 0.692 (95% CI 0.523-0.915; pnon-inferiority<0.0001,
      psuperiority=0.009, thus cisplatin plus gemcitabine was both non-inferior to and 
      superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Median progression-free survival was
      7.73 months (95% CI 6.16-9.30) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 6.47
      months (5.76-7.18) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse
      events that differed significantly between the two groups included nausea (eight 
      [7%] vs one [<1%]), vomiting (13 [11%] vs one [<1%]), musculoskeletal pain (none 
      vs ten [8%]), anaemia (39 [33%] vs six [5%]), and thrombocytopenia (38 [32%] vs
      three [3%]), for the cisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with the paclitaxel plus
      gemcitabine groups, respectively. In addition, patients in the cisplatin plus
      gemcitabine group had significantly fewer events of grade 1-4 alopecia (12 [10%] 
      vs 42 [36%]) and peripheral neuropathy (27 [23%] vs 60 [51%]), but more grade 1-4
      anorexia (33 [28%] vs 10 [8%]), constipation (29 [25%] vs 11 [9%]),
      hypomagnesaemia (27 [23%] vs five [4%]), and hypokalaemia (10 [8%] vs two [2%]). 
      Serious drug-related adverse events were seen in three patients in the paclitaxel
      plus gemcitabine group (interstitial pneumonia, anaphylaxis, and severe
      neutropenia) and four in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group (pathological bone 
      fracture, thrombocytopenia with subcutaneous haemorrhage, severe anaemia, and
      cardiogenic syncope). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION:
      Cisplatin plus gemcitabine could be an alternative or even the preferred
      first-line chemotherapy strategy for patients with metastatic triple-negative
      breast cancer. FUNDING: Shanghai Natural Science Foundation.

TI  - Timing of adjuvant surgical oophorectomy in the menstrual cycle and disease-free 
      and overall survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For women with hormone receptor-positive, operable breast cancer,
      surgical oophorectomy plus tamoxifen is an effective adjuvant therapy. We
      conducted a phase III randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that
      oophorectomy surgery performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was
      associated with better outcomes. METHODS: Seven hundred forty premenopausal women
      entered a clinical trial in which those women estimated not to be in the luteal
      phase of their menstrual cycle for the next one to six days (n = 509) were
      randomly assigned to receive treatment with surgical oophorectomy either delayed 
      to be during a five-day window in the history-estimated midluteal phase of the
      menstrual cycles, or in the next one to six days. Women who were estimated to be 
      in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for the next one to six days (n = 231)
      were excluded from random assignment and received immediate surgical treatments. 
      All patients began tamoxifen within 6 days of surgery and continued this for 5
      years. Kaplan-Meier methods, the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox regression 
      models were used to assess differences in five-year disease-free survival (DFS)
      between the groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The randomized
      midluteal phase surgery group had a five-year DFS of 64%, compared with 71% for
      the immediate surgery random assignment group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 1.68, P = .18). Multivariable Cox regression
      models, which included important prognostic variables, gave similar results (aHR 
      = 1.28, 95% CI = 0.94 to 1.76, P = .12). For overall survival, the univariate
      hazard ratio was 1.33 (95% CI = 0.94 to 1.89, P = .11) and the multivariable aHR 
      was 1.43 (95% CI = 1.00 to 2.06, P = .05). Better DFS for follicular phase
      surgery, which was unanticipated, proved consistent across multiple exploratory
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesized benefit of adjuvant luteal phase
      oophorectomy was not shown in this large trial.

TI  - Intra-tumour signalling entropy determines clinical outcome in breast and lung
      cancer.
PG  - e1004115
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004115 [doi]
AB  - The cancer stem cell hypothesis, that a small population of tumour cells are
      responsible for tumorigenesis and cancer progression, is becoming widely accepted
      and recent evidence has suggested a prognostic and predictive role for such
      cells. Intra-tumour heterogeneity, the diversity of the cancer cell population
      within the tumour of an individual patient, is related to cancer stem cells and
      is also considered a potential prognostic indicator in oncology. The measurement 
      of cancer stem cell abundance and intra-tumour heterogeneity in a clinically
      relevant manner however, currently presents a challenge. Here we propose
      signalling entropy, a measure of signalling pathway promiscuity derived from a
      sample's genome-wide gene expression profile, as an estimate of the stemness of a
      tumour sample. By considering over 500 mixtures of diverse cellular expression
      profiles, we reveal that signalling entropy also associates with intra-tumour
      heterogeneity. By analysing 3668 breast cancer and 1692 lung adenocarcinoma
      samples, we further demonstrate that signalling entropy correlates negatively
      with survival, outperforming leading clinical gene expression based prognostic
      tools. Signalling entropy is found to be a general prognostic measure, valid in
      different breast cancer clinical subgroups, as well as within stage I lung
      adenocarcinoma. We find that its prognostic power is driven by genes involved in 
      cancer stem cells and treatment resistance. In summary, by approximating both
      stemness and intra-tumour heterogeneity, signalling entropy provides a powerful
      prognostic measure across different epithelial cancers.

TI  - Indispensability of chemotherapy in estrogen receptor-negative early breast
      cancer in elderly women with diabetes mellitus.

LID - 10.1089/dia.2014.0226 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate whether chemotherapy is indispensable in elderly patients with early 
      estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer and diabetes mellitus (DM), the
      data on 112 patients, >/=70 years of age, with early, operable ER-negative breast
      cancer who were treated at the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai,
      China, between 2000 and 2010, were analyzed. The overall survival (OS),
      disease-free survival (DFS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCS) were
      compared. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox 
      proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the prognostic value of DM and
      chemotherapy for OS, DFS, and BCS. The univariate Cox regression analysis
      revealed that DM at diagnosis, the number of positive lymph nodes, and
      radiotherapy were associated with OS, the number of positive lymph nodes, human
      epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2/neu) status, and radiotherapy were associated
      with DFS, and the number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size, HER2/neu status,
      chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were associated with BCS. The subsequent
      multivariate analysis identified DM at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR]=3.797; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.515-9.520; P=0.004) as an independent prognostic
      factor for OS (with the addition of chemotherapy regimen). Chemotherapy was not
      an independent prognostic factor for either OS (HR=1.275; 95% CI, 0.614-2.646;
      P=0.515) or DFS (HR=0.849; 95% CI, 0.445-1.619; P=0.619) when other possible
      factors that may affect the results were adjusted. In conclusion, chemotherapy
      was not found to be indispensable for elderly (>/=70 years of age) female
      patients with early ER-negative breast cancer with DM because, particularly in
      such patients, the treatment of DM may be more important compared with
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Impact of genetic variants of RFC1, DHFR and MTHFR in osteosarcoma patients
      treated with high-dose methotrexate.
PG  - 385-90
LID - 10.1038/tpj.2015.11 [doi]
AB  - Osteosarcoma patients are commonly treated with high doses of methotrexate (MTX).
      MTX is an analog of folate, which is essential for DNA synthesis. Genetic
      polymorphism at single nucleotide can be indicative to the prognostic outcome in 
      patients. Germ-line variants in candidate genes, coding for enzymes active in the
      metabolism of MTX, were studied in 62 osteosarcoma patients. Patients harboring
      the GG genotype in reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) rs1051266 had significantly
      better survival in comparison with patients having the AA genotype (P=0.046).
      These patients also had a lower frequency of metastasis (15%, P=0.029). Also
      patients homozygous for the G allele of rs1053129 in the dihydrofolate reductase 
      (DHFR) gene were more likely to have a metastasis (45%, P= 0.005), and the
      methylenetetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C allele was associated with
      higher degree of liver toxicity (88%, P=0.007). The study suggests that germ-line
      variants in the MTX metabolic pathway are associated with survival and side
      effects in patients treated with MTX.

AB  - PURPOSE: We designed the present study to investigate differences in prognostic
      factors and failure patterns between patients with invasive micropapillary
      carcinoma or carcinoma with micropapillary component (IMPC) and randomly matched 
      patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast at multiple
      institutions of the Korean Radiation Oncology Group (KROG). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study was performed using subjects
      treated from January 1999 to November 2011. Female patients who had undergone
      curative resection for breast cancer without neoadjuvant chemotherapy were
      considered for this study. Exact matches were made for age (+/- 3 years),
      pathologic tumor and node stage, treatment method (surgery with or without
      radiotherapy), and period when surgery was performed (within 1 year) at the same 
      institution. RESULTS: A total of 534 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up
      period was 59 months in both groups. In the comparison of clinicopathologic
      characteristics, rates of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and nuclear grade III
      were both significantly higher in IMPC than in IDC (P < .001, P = .01,
      respectively). During the follow-up period, recurrences developed in 40 patients 
      with IMPC (15.0%) and 21 with IDC (7.9%). Locoregional recurrence (LRR) developed
      in 22 patients with IMPC (8.2%) and 10 with IDC (3.7%). The rate of distant
      metastasis did not differ between the 2 groups (P = .52). LRR-free survival (P = 
      .03) and recurrence-free survival (P = .007) were significantly different between
      the 2 groups, but overall survival was not (P = .67). CONCLUSION: IMPC is
      associated with a higher rate of LVI, high nuclear grade, and a propensity for
      LRR compared to IDC. Modification of the locoregional treatment modality might be
      needed in this pathologic subtype of breast cancer.

TI  - ANGPTL2 increases bone metastasis of breast cancer cells through enhancing CXCR4 
      signaling.
PG  - 9170
LID - 10.1038/srep09170 [doi]
AB  - Bone metastasis of breast cancer cells is a major concern, as it causes increased
      morbidity and mortality in patients. Bone tissue-derived CXCL12 preferentially
      recruits breast cancer cells expressing CXCR4 to bone metastatic sites. Thus,
      understanding how CXCR4 expression is regulated in breast cancer cells could
      suggest approaches to decrease bone metastasis of breast tumor cells. Here, we
      show that tumor cell-derived angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) increases
      responsiveness of breast cancer cells to CXCL12 by promoting up-regulation of
      CXCR4 in those cells. In addition, we used a xenograft mouse model established by
      intracardiac injection of tumor cells to show that ANGPTL2 knockdown in breast
      cancer cells attenuates tumor cell responsiveness to CXCL12 by decreasing CXCR4
      expression in those cells, thereby decreasing bone metastasis. Finally, we found 
      that ANGPTL2 and CXCR4 expression levels within primary tumor tissues from breast
      cancer patients are positively correlated. We conclude that tumor cell-derived
      ANGPTL2 may increase bone metastasis by enhancing breast tumor cell
      responsiveness to CXCL12 signaling through up-regulation of tumor cell CXCR4
      expression. These findings may suggest novel therapeutic approaches to treat
      metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Time Trends of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Myocardial Deformation
      Indices in a Cohort of Women with Breast Cancer Treated with Anthracyclines,
      Taxanes, and Trastuzumab.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a HER2 monoclonal antibody, has transformed the
      prognosis of patients with the aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer type.
      Trastuzumab augments the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines, but its effect is
      thought to be at least partially reversible. The objective of this study was to
      examine the time trends of left ventricular (LV) size and function in a cohort of
      women treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients 
      >18 years of age with first-time breast cancer treated with anthracyclines and
      trastuzumab were monitored using echocardiography before, at the completion of,
      and at a median follow-up of 24.7 months (interquartile range, 15.9-34 months)
      after the end of their cancer treatment. LV volume, LV ejection fraction, and
      global peak systolic longitudinal strain and strain rate were measured in the
      apical four- and two-chamber views. Left ventricular ejection fraction was
      measured using a modified Simpson's biplane method. RESULTS: LV end-diastolic and
      end-systolic volumes increased at the end of treatment compared with baseline and
      did not recover during follow-up. Left ventricular ejection fraction, strain, and
      strain rate decreased at the end of treatment compared with baseline (from 64 +/-
      6% to 59 +/- 8%, from -20.0 +/- 2.5% to -17.6 +/- 2.6%, and from -1.26 +/- 0.23
      to -1.13 +/- 0.16 sec(-1), respectively; P < .05 for all parameters) and remained
      decreased at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: LV dilation and subclinical impairment in
      cardiac function persists >2 years after the end of anthracycline and trastuzumab
      treatment, without significant recovery after trastuzumab cessation, suggestive
      of long-term underlying cardiac damage and remodeling.

TI  - A phase II study of single-agent RO4929097, a gamma-secretase inhibitor of Notch

      cancer: A study of the Princess Margaret, Chicago and California phase II
      consortia.

AB  - PURPOSE: A phase II study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      single-agent RO4929097 (a gamma-secretase inhibitor) in patients with recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Women with progressive
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with </=2 chemotherapy regimens for
      recurrent disease were enrolled in this trial. Patients received oral RO4929097
      at 20 mg once daily, 3 days on/4 days off each week in a three week cycle. The
      primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at the end of 4 cycles.
      Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety of RO4929097 and
      exploration of molecular correlates of outcome in archival tumor tissue and
      serum. RESULTS: Of 45 patients enrolled, 40 were evaluable for response.
      Thirty-seven (82%) patients had high-grade ovarian cancer. No objective responses
      were observed. Fifteen patients (33%) had stable disease as their best response, 
      with a median duration of 3.1 months. The median PFS for the whole group was 1.3 
      months (1.2-2.5). Treatment was generally well tolerated with 10% of patients
      discontinuing treatment due to an adverse event. In high grade serous ovarian
      cancer patients, the median PFS trended higher when the expression of
      intracellular Notch (NICD) protein by immunohistochemistry was high versus low
      (3.3 versus 1.3 months, p=0.09). No clear relationship between circulating
      angiogenic factors and PFS was found despite a suggestion of an improved outcome 
      with higher baseline VEGFA levels. CONCLUSIONS: RO4929097 has insufficient
      activity as a single-agent in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to warrant
      further study as monotherapy. Future studies are needed to explore the potential 
      for cohort enrichment using NICD expression.

TI  - Walking, biking or sport: how Spanish women attending breast cancer screening
      meet physical activity recommendations?
PG  - 857-63
LID - 10.1093/eurpub/cku248 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim is to analyse physical activity (PA), the fulfillment
      recommendation of at least 150 min of moderate PA, through walking/biking (W&B), 
      sport, both types of PA and the factors associated with inactivity by Spanish
      women who attended breast cancer screening programmes. METHODS: The DDM-Spain is 
      a multicentre cross-sectional study involving 3584 women, aged 45-68, attending
      screening in seven Spanish cities. Data were collected using a questionnaire,
      including age, socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, family burden and
      PA. PA was converted into metabolic equivalent of task (METs), categorized as low
      </= 600 METs min per week (m/w), moderate 600-3000 METs m/w and high >/= 3000
      METs m/w. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify variables 
      associated with inactivity for each type of PA. RESULTS: No women achieved a high
      level of PA through sport. 79.2% achieved a high or moderate level of PA by W&B. 
      Lack of sport was associated with being overweight (odds ratio OR = 1.31; 95%
      confidence interval CI: 1.06 to 1.62), body mass index (BMI) >/= 30 (OR = 1.85;
      95% CI: 1.44 to 2.38), smoking (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.00) and living with 
      a disabled person (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.81), whereas enough sport practice
      was associated with higher educational or socio-economic level (SEL). Regarding
      W&B, inactivity was associated with BMI >/= 30 (OR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.45) 
      and living with someone >74 (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.58). Inactivity for
      both types of exercise was associated with a BMI >/= 30 (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.63 
      to 2.8), smoking (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.81) and living with someone >74
      (OR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.24 to 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Family burden and BMI >/= 30 are 
      inversely associated with both types of PA. W&B is the most common type of PA
      regardless of educational and SEL.

AB  - Myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase are heme-containing enzymes often
      physically associated with fibrotic tissue and cancer in various organs, without 
      any direct involvement in promoting fibroblast recruitment and extracellular
      matrix (ECM) biosynthesis at these sites. We report herein novel findings that
      show peroxidase enzymes possess a well-conserved profibrogenic capacity to
      stimulate the migration of fibroblastic cells and promote their ability to
      secrete collagenous proteins to generate a functional ECM both in vitro and in
      vivo. Mechanistic studies conducted using cultured fibroblasts show that these
      cells are capable of rapidly binding and internalizing both myeloperoxidase and
      eosinophil peroxidase. Peroxidase enzymes stimulate collagen biosynthesis at a
      post-translational level in a prolyl 4-hydroxylase-dependent manner that does not
      require ascorbic acid. This response was blocked by the irreversible
      myeloperoxidase inhibitor 4-amino-benzoic acid hydrazide, indicating peroxidase
      catalytic activity is essential for collagen biosynthesis. These results suggest 
      that peroxidase enzymes, such as myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, may
      play a fundamental role in regulating the recruitment of fibroblast and the
      biosynthesis of collagen ECM at sites of normal tissue repair and fibrosis, with 
      enormous implications for many disease states where infiltrating inflammatory
      cells deposit peroxidases.

TI  - Stage IV breast cancer: a population-based study about prognostic factors
      according to HER2 and HR status.
PG  - 920-8
LID - 10.1111/ecc.12306 [doi]
AB  - We aim to describe trends in net survival (NS) and to assess the prognostic
      factors among women with de novo metastatic breast cancer (MBC) according to
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and hormone receptor (HR) status.
      Data on women suffering from de novo MBC and diagnosed from 1998 to 2009 were
      provided by the Cote-d'Or breast cancer registry. NS was described using the
      Pohar Perme estimator and prognostic factors were investigated in a generalised
      linear model. We identified 232 patients (mean age = 64.7). Median NS was 29.2
      months, 1- and 5-year NS were 76% and 26% respectively. The survival trend in
      patients with HER2-positive tumours who did not receive trastuzumab was similar
      to that in women with triple-negative tumours. A higher relative excess risk of
      death by cancer was observed for high-grade tumours [RER, relative excess rates =
      1.76 (95% CI, confidence intervals: 1.17-2.62) for Scarff Bloom Richardson grade 
      3 vs. 1 + 2], while a lower risk was observed for luminal tumours [RER = 0.49
      (95% CI: 0.27-0.89)] and HER2-positive tumours treated with trastuzumab [RER =
      0.28 (95% CI: 0.14-0.59)], both compared with triple-negative tumours. Surgery of
      the primary tumour was associated with better survival [RER = 0.43 (95% CI:
      0.28-0.68)]. With half of the women dead before 29 months, stage IV breast cancer
      still has a bleak outlook. Progress should continue with new target therapies for
      both HR and HER2 receptors.

TI  - Elevated Aurora B expression contributes to chemoresistance and poor prognosis in
      breast cancer.
PG  - 751-7
AB  - Aurora-B is a major kinase responsible for appropriate mitotic progression.
      Elevated expression of Aurora-B has been frequently associated with several types
      of cancer, including breast cancer. However, it is not clear whether the
      alteration contributes to tumor responses to therapies and prognosis. In this
      study, we conducted immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Aurora-B,
      S1981p-ATM, Ki67, and p53 in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 312 invasive
      breast cancer patients. The correlation between disease-free-survival (DFS) and
      Aurora-B expression was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.
      A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine whether
      Aurora-B was an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer. We found that
      Aurora-B expression was correlated with the proliferation index (P < 0.001) and
      p53 expression (P = 0.014) in breast cancer tissues. Further we found that
      Aurora-B expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002) and
      histological grade (P = 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that elevated
      Aurora-B expression predicted a poor survival. In a subgroup of patients that
      received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we found that elevated Aurora-B contributed to
      chemoresistance (P = 0.011). In conclusion, elevated Aurora-B expression in
      breast cancer patients contributes to chemoresistance and predicts poor
      prognosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to identify key characteristics associated
      with mortality from breast cancer among women with newly diagnosed breast cancer 
      in New Zealand (NZ). STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: All primary
      breast cancers diagnosed between 01/01/2002 and 31/12/2010 in Waikato, NZ, were
      identified from the Waikato Breast Cancer Register. A total of 258 breast cancer 
      deaths were identified from 1767 invasive cancers diagnosed over this period.
      RESULTS: Breast cancer deaths (n = 246) were compared with an age and year of
      diagnosis matched control group (n = 652) who were alive at the time of the death
      of the corresponding case and subsequently did not die from breast cancer.
      Diagnosis through symptomatic presentation, advanced stage, higher grade, absent 
      hormone receptors (i.e. oestrogen and progesterone) and HER-2 amplification were 
      associated with significantly higher risks of breast cancer mortality in
      bivariate analysis. Tumour stage, grade and hormone receptor status remained
      significant in the multivariable model, while mode of detection and HER-2 status 
      were non-significant. In the bivariate analysis, Maori women had a higher risk of
      breast cancer mortality compared to NZ European women (OR 1.34) which was
      statistically non-significant. However in the adjusted model, risk of mortality
      was lower for Maori compared to NZ European women, although this was not
      significant statistically (OR 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality pattern from breast
      cancer in this study were associated with established risk factors. Ethnic
      inequity in breast cancer mortality in NZ appears to be largely attributable to
      delay in diagnosis and tumour related factors. Further research in a larger
      cohort is needed to identify the full impact of these factors on ethnic inequity 
      in breast cancer mortality.

AB  - In the present study we examined the role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) 
      in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we report that TSLP
      knock-out (KO) mice display a delayed onset of disease and an attenuated form of 
      EAE. This delayed onset was accompanied by a reduced number of encephalitogenic T
      helper type 1 (Th1) cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of TSLP KO mice. In
      addition, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from CNS of TSLP KO mice show a reduced
      activation status in comparison to wild-type mice. It is noteworthy that we could
      also show that lymph node cells from TSLP KO mice expanded less efficiently and
      that interleukin (IL)-6-, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha levels were reduced. Furthermore, CD3(+) T cells isolated in the
      preclinical phase from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55
      (MOG(35-55))-immunized TSLP KO mice showed a reduced response after secondary
      exposure to MOG(35-55), indicating that differentiation of naive T cells into
      MOG(35-55)-specific effector and memory T cells was impaired in KO mice. The
      addition of recombinant TSLP enhanced T cell proliferation during MOG(35-55)
      restimulation, showing that T cells also respond directly to TSLP. In summary,
      these data demonstrate that expression of, and immune activation by, TSLP
      contributes significantly to the immunopathology of EAE.

TI  - Cytokeratin 5/6 fingerprinting in HER2-positive tumors identifies a poor
      prognosis and trastuzumab-resistant basal-HER2 subtype of breast cancer.
PG  - 7104-22
AB  - There is an urgent need to refine the prognostic taxonomy of HER2+ breast
      carcinomas and develop easy-to-use, clinic-based prediction algorithms to
      distinguish between good- and poor- responders to trastuzumab-based therapy.
      Building on earlier studies suggesting that HER2+ tumors enriched with molecular 
      and morpho-immunohistochemical features classically ascribed to basal-like tumors
      are highly aggressive and refractory to trastuzumab, we investigated the
      prognostic and predictive value of the basal-HER2+ phenotype in
      HER2-overexpressing tumors. Our retrospective cohort study of a consecutive
      series of 152 HER2+ primary invasive ductal breast carcinomas first confirmed the
      existence of a distinct subgroup co-expressing HER2 protein and basal cytokeratin
      markers CK5/6, the so-called basal-HER2+ phenotype. Basal-HER2+ phenotype (>/=10%
      of cells showing positive CK5/6 staining), but not estrogen receptor status, was 
      significantly associated with inferior overall survival by univariate analysis
      and predicted worsened disease free survival after accounting for strong
      prognostic variables such as tumor size at diagnosis in stepwise multivariate
      analysis. In the sub-cohort of HER2+ patients treated with trastuzumab-based
      adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy, basal-HER2+ phenotype was found to be the sole
      independent prognostic marker for a significantly inferior time to treatment
      failure in multivariate analysis. A CK5/6-based immunohistochemical fingerprint
      may provide a simple, rapid, and accurate method for re-classifying women
      diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer in a manner that can improve prognosis and
      therapeutic planning in patients with clinically aggressive basal-HER2+ tumors
      who are not likely to benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy.

TI  - What Is the Optimum Timing of Postmastectomy Radiotherapy in Two-Stage Prosthetic
      Reconstruction: Radiation to the Tissue Expander or Permanent Implant?
PG  - 1509-1517
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001278 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmastectomy radiotherapy is increasingly common for patients with 
      advanced breast cancer. The optimal timing and sequence of mastectomy,
      reconstruction, and radiotherapy remains unresolved for patients choosing
      immediate two-stage prosthetic reconstruction. METHODS: Long-term outcomes were
      compared for all patients with prosthetic-based reconstruction without radiation,
      radiation to the tissue expander, or to the permanent implant from 2003 to 2012
      performed by the senior author (P.G.C.). Surgeon-evaluated outcomes included
      reconstructive failure, aesthetic results, and capsular contracture. Odds of
      failure with radiotherapy at different times were evaluated with logistic
      regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed
      using the BREAST-Q. RESULTS: A total of 1486 reconstructions without radiation,
      94 reconstructions with tissue expander radiation, and 210 reconstructions with
      permanent implant radiation were included. Six-year predicted failure rates were 
      greater for patients with tissue expander radiation than for patients with
      permanent implant radiation (32 percent versus 16.4 percent; p < 0.01). Patients 
      undergoing radiation to the tissue expander had a greater proportion of very good
      to excellent aesthetic results compared to patients with permanent implant
      radiation (75.0 percent versus 67.6 percent; p < 0.01) and lower rates of grade
      IV capsular contracture (p < 0.01). BREAST-Q scores were similar for patients
      with the different radiation timings. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of
      reconstructive failure is significantly higher for patients with tissue expander 
      radiation compared to patients with permanent implant radiation, the aesthetic
      results and capsular contracture rates are slightly better. Patient reported
      outcomes do not differ between patients with tissue expander or permanent implant
      radiation. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2175-84
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29330 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors have only very limited treatment options for 
      menopausal symptoms. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effects of a
      12-week traditional Hatha yoga and meditation intervention on menopausal symptoms
      in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned either to a 
      12-week yoga and meditation intervention or to usual care. The primary outcome
      measure was total menopausal symptoms (Menopause Rating Scale [MRS] total score).
      Secondary outcome measures included MRS subscales, quality of life (Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy-Fatigue), depression, and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale). Outcomes were assessed at week 12 and week 24 after
      randomization. RESULTS: In total, 40 women (mean age +/- standard deviation, 49.2
      +/- 5.9 years) were randomized to yoga (n = 19) or to usual care (n = 21). Women 
      in the yoga group reported significantly lower total menopausal symptoms compared
      with the usual care group at week 12 (mean difference, -5.6; 95% confidence
      interval, -9.2 to -1.9; P = .004) and at week 24 (mean difference, -4.5; 95%
      confidence interval, -8.3 to -0.7; P = .023). At week 12, the yoga group reported
      less somatovegetative, psychological, and urogenital menopausal symptoms; less
      fatigue; and improved quality of life (all P < .05). At week 24, all effects
      persisted except for psychological menopausal symptoms. Short-term effects on
      menopausal symptoms remained significant when only women who were receiving
      antiestrogen medication (n = 36) were analyzed. Six minor adverse events occurred
      in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga combined with meditation can be considered a
      safe and effective complementary intervention for menopausal symptoms in breast
      cancer survivors. The effects seem to persist for at least 3 months.

TI  - Goserelin for ovarian protection during breast-cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.
PG  - 923-32
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1413204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ovarian failure is a common toxic effect of chemotherapy. Studies of 
      the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to protect ovarian
      function have shown mixed results and lack data on pregnancy outcomes. METHODS:
      We randomly assigned 257 premenopausal women with operable
      hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer to receive standard chemotherapy with the
      GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group) or standard chemotherapy without
      goserelin (chemotherapy-alone group). The primary study end point was the rate of
      ovarian failure at 2 years, with ovarian failure defined as the absence of menses
      in the preceding 6 months and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the
      postmenopausal range. Rates were compared with the use of conditional logistic
      regression. Secondary end points included pregnancy outcomes and disease-free and
      overall survival. RESULTS: At baseline, 218 patients were eligible and could be
      evaluated. Among 135 with complete primary end-point data, the ovarian failure
      rate was 8% in the goserelin group and 22% in the chemotherapy-alone group (odds 
      ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.97; two-sided P=0.04). Owing
      to missing primary end-point data, sensitivity analyses were performed, and the
      results were consistent with the main findings. Missing data did not differ
      according to treatment group or according to the stratification factors of age
      and planned chemotherapy regimen. Among the 218 patients who could be evaluated, 
      pregnancy occurred in more women in the goserelin group than in the
      chemotherapy-alone group (21% vs. 11%, P=0.03); women in the goserelin group also
      had improved disease-free survival (P=0.04) and overall survival (P=0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Although missing data weaken interpretation of the findings,
      administration of goserelin with chemotherapy appeared to protect against ovarian
      failure, reducing the risk of early menopause and improving prospects for
      fertility. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; POEMS/S0230

TI  - Guidelines for time-to-event end point definitions in breast cancer trials:
      results of the DATECAN initiative (Definition for the Assessment of Time-to-event
      Endpoints in CANcer trials)dagger.
PG  - 873-9
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using surrogate end points for overall survival, such as disease-free
      survival, is increasingly common in randomized controlled trials. However, the
      definitions of several of these time-to-event (TTE) end points are imprecisely
      which limits interpretation and cross-trial comparisons. The estimation of
      treatment effects may be directly affected by the definitions of end points. The 
      DATECAN initiative (Definition for the Assessment of Time-to-event Endpoints in
      CANcer trials) aims to provide recommendations for definitions of TTE end points.
      We report guidelines for randomized cancer clinical trials (RCTs) in breast
      cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A literature review was carried out to identify TTE
      end points (primary or secondary) reported in publications of randomized trials
      or guidelines. An international multidisciplinary panel of experts proposed
      recommendations for the definitions of these end points based on a validated
      consensus method that formalize the degree of agreement among experts. RESULTS:
      Recommended guidelines for the definitions of TTE end points commonly used in
      RCTs for breast cancer are provided for non-metastatic and metastatic settings.
      CONCLUSION: The use of standardized definitions should facilitate comparisons of 
      trial results and improve the quality of trial design and reporting. These
      guidelines could be of particular interest to those involved in the design,
      conducting, reporting, or assessment of RCT.

TI  - Antitumor effect of conditioned media derived from murine MSCs and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells are multi-potent progenitor cells that inhibit
      tumor growth by some ligands and releasing factors including TRAIL, DKK-1 and
      DKK-3. On other hands, photodynamic therapy is commonly used for treatment of
      different types of cancer. The aims of this study are to investigate of MSCs
      conditioned media and ALA mediated photodynamic therapy in breast cancer.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Condition media was derived after documentation of mouse
      adipose derived MSCs. For photodynamic therapy (PDT), ALA was used at the final
      concentrations of 1mM for 4-h followed by exposure to red light with a peak wave 
      length of 632-nm, delivered from diode laser located at 2 cm to achieve a total
      light dose of 5 Joules (J)/cm(2). Apoptosis and growth of 4T1 cancer cells were
      analyzed in different groups including MSCs derived condition media, PDT and MSCs
      derived condition media plus PDT by flow cytometry. Growth of cancer cells were
      assessed using MTT test. RESULTS: Our findings showed expression of TRAIL on
      mouse adipose-derived MSCs surfaces. Furthermore, treatment of 4T1 cancer cells
      with MSCs conditioned media cause to inhibit the cancer cells growth. Also, MSCs 
      conditioned media with PDT have significantly synergic effects to induce
      apoptosis in breast cancer cells (P < 0.05). Growth of cancer cells remarkably
      decreased after treatment with MSCs conditioned media and PDT in time-dependent
      manner (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Results revealed that MSCs conditioned media
      induced the apoptosis in 4T1 breast cancer cells and apoptotic effects of MSCs
      conditioned media were intensified following photodynamic therapy. This study
      showed that MSCs conditioned media combined with PDT may be useful as a novel
      treatment modality into the development of therapeutic strategies for treatment
      of breast cancer.

TI  - Predictors for local invasive recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ of the
      breast: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 19-28
LID - 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000131 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of mammographic screening has considerably increased the
      detection rate of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which has a high probability
      of recurrence. We carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive factors 
      including biomarkers, tumor characteristics, and modes of detection on the risk
      of local invasive recurrence (LIR) following DCIS. Searches were performed in
      PubMed and EMBASE up to 8 July 2014. Risk estimates (hazard ratios, odds ratios, 
      and relative risks) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted to
      calculate the strength of the associations between predictive factors and the
      risk of LIR after treatment of DCIS. STATA 12.0 was used to combine results in
      this meta-analysis. A total of 18 articles were included in the analysis. Pooled 
      risk estimates and 95% CIs were 1.36 (1.04-1.69) for the positive margin, 1.38
      (1.12-1.63) for the nonscreening detection method, 1.04 (0.84-1.24) for high
      nuclear grade 1, 1.32 (0.98-1.66) for intermediate nuclear grade 2, 1.18
      (0.98-1.37) for comedonecrosis, 1.00 (0.92-1.08) for large tumor size, 1.34
      (0.82-1.87) for multifocality, 0.74 (0.36-1.12) for estrogen receptor-positive
      tumors, 0.89 (0.47-1.31) for progesterone receptor-positive tumors, and 1.25
      (0.7-1.81) for HER2/neu-positive tumors. Positive margin and
      non-screening-detected cancers were associated with a higher risk of LIR
      following DCIS. These predictive factors, after further validation, could be
      considered to tailor treatment for individual patients.

TI  - Specific roles of each TCR hemichain in generating functional chain-centric TCR.
PG  - 3487-500
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1401717 [doi]
AB  - TCRalpha- and beta-chains cooperatively recognize peptide-MHC complexes. It has
      been shown that a "chain-centric" TCR hemichain can, by itself, dictate
      MHC-restricted Ag specificity without requiring major contributions from the
      paired TCR counterchain. Little is known, however, regarding the relative
      contributions and roles of chain-centric and its counter, non-chain-centric,
      hemichains in determining T cell avidity. We comprehensively analyzed a
      thymically unselected T cell repertoire generated by transducing the
      alpha-chain-centric HLA-A*02:01(A2)/MART127-35 TCRalpha, clone SIG35alpha, into
      A2-matched and unmatched postthymic T cells. Regardless of their HLA-A2
      positivity, a substantial subset of peripheral T cells transduced with SIG35alpha
      gained reactivity for A2/MART127-35. Although the generated
      A2/MART127-35-specific T cells used various TRBV genes, TRBV27 predominated with 
      >10(2) highly diverse and unique clonotypic CDR3beta sequences. T cells
      individually reconstituted with various A2/MART127-35 TRBV27 TCRbeta genes along 
      with SIG35alpha possessed a wide range (>2 log orders) of avidity. Approximately 
      half possessed avidity higher than T cells expressing clone DMF5, a naturally
      occurring A2/MART127-35 TCR with one of the highest affinities. Importantly,
      similar findings were recapitulated with other self-Ags. Our results indicate
      that, although a chain-centric TCR hemichain determines Ag specificity, the
      paired counterchain can regulate avidity over a broad range (>2 log orders)
      without compromising Ag specificity. TCR chain centricity can be exploited to
      generate a thymically unselected Ag-specific T cell repertoire, which can be used
      to isolate high-avidity antitumor T cells and their uniquely encoded TCRs rarely 
      found in the periphery because of tolerance.

TI  - Comparison of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging with
      Sonography in the Prediction of Breast Cancer Tumor Size: A Concordance Analysis 
      with Histopathologically Determined Tumor Size.
PG  - 3816-23
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4424-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to effectively treat patients with breast cancer, it is
      important to know the precise tumor size. We compared the rates of concordance of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived and sonography-derived breast cancer
      tumor size with histopathologically determined tumor size. METHODS: Accuracy of
      MRI and sonography in establishing tumor size was evaluated by comparing
      preoperative images with postoperative pathologic findings. The accuracy of MRI
      and sonography was graded as concordance, underestimation, or overestimation and 
      was compared in different subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 682 patients comprised
      the study cohort. Mean tumor size was 3.64 +/- 1.8 cm via MRI, 2.12 +/- 1.0 cm
      via sonography, and 2.78 +/- 1.7 cm via pathologic examination. The difference
      between breast sonography and MRI to pathologic tumor field size was -0.68 +/-
      1.4, and 0.85 +/- 1.25 cm, respectively (P < 0.001). Sonography had a concordance
      rate of 54.3 %, an overestimated rate of 9.8 %, and an underestimated rate of
      35.9 %. For MRI, the concordance rate was 44.1 %, the overestimated rate was 52.5
      %, and the underestimated rate was 3.4 %. In subgroup analysis, breast MRI had a 
      higher concordance rate in patients with T3 (>5 cm) lesions. When the results of 
      MRI and sonography were considered together, the concordance rate increased from 
      54.3 to 62.2 %. CONCLUSION: MRI tends to overestimate the actual tumor size,
      while sonography frequently underestimates it. Combined sonography and MRI
      increases the accuracy of tumor size prediction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer treatment in elderly patients is controversial. This 
      single-centre study was conducted to review the treatment and outcomes for
      octogenarian women treated for breast cancer. METHODS: Data from all patients
      aged 80 years or more with primary breast cancer treated at our institution
      between 1995 and 2012 were included. Patients with carcinoma in-situ (stage 0)
      and advanced breast cancer (stage IV) were excluded. RESULTS: The study
      population consisted of 369 patients (median age 84 years). A total of 277 (75%) 
      patients underwent surgical treatment (PST) and 92 (25%) received primary
      endocrine treatment (PET). Prognostic factors (HER-2, tumour grade,
      lymphovascular invasion and subsequent adjuvant therapy) were homogeneously
      distributed in both groups. PST and PET were stratified according to stage: 273
      (66%) patients with early stage disease (I, IIA, IIB) and 96 (34%) with locally
      advanced disease (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC). Patients were followed-up for a median of 63
      months. In patients with early stage disease, the mean breast cancer-specific
      survival (BCSS) was 109 months (95% CI = 101-115) in PST patients, and 50 months 
      (95% CI = 40-60) in PET patients (P < 0.01). Conversely, for patients with
      locally advanced breast cancer, there was no significant difference in BCSS
      between the surgical and non-surgical groups. In the PST group, BCSS and
      disease-free survival were significantly better among patients who underwent
      standard surgical treatment than among those who received suboptimal treatment.
      There were no differences in the Charlson comorbidity index scores between the
      PST and PET groups. CONCLUSION: In women >/=80 years with early-stage breast
      cancer, standard surgical treatment was associated with a better BCSS when
      compared with PET.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
      aberrations play significant roles in breast cancer occurrence and development.
      However, the status of EGFR and AKT1 gene copy numbers remains unclear. In this
      study, we showed that the rates of EGFR and AKT1 gene copy number alterations
      were associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. Among 205 patients, high
      EGFR and AKT1 gene copy numbers were observed in 34.6% and 27.8% of cases by
      multi-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. Co-heightened
      EGFR/AKT1 gene copy numbers were identified in 11.7% cases. No changes were found
      in 49.3% of patients. Although changes in EGFR and AKT1 gene copy numbers had no 
      correlation with patients' age, tumor stage, histological grade and the
      expression status of other molecular makers, high EGFR (P = 0.0002) but not AKT1 
      (P = 0.1177) gene copy numbers correlated with poor 5-year overall survival. The 
      patients with co-heightened EGFR/AKT1 gene copy numbers displayed a poorer
      prognosis than those with tumors with only high EGFR gene copy numbers (P =
      0.0383). Both Univariate (U) and COX multivariate (C) analyses revealed that high
      EGFR and AKT1 gene copy numbers (P = 0.000 [U], P = 0.0001 [C]), similar to
      histological grade (P = 0.001 [U], P = 0.012 [C]) and lymph node metastasis (P = 
      0.046 [U], P = 0.158 [C]), were independent prognostic indicators of 5-year
      overall survival. These results indicate that high EGFR and AKT1 gene copy
      numbers were relatively frequent in breast cancer. Co-heightened EGFR/AKT1 gene
      copy numbers had a worse outcome than those with only high EGFR gene copy
      numbers, suggesting that evaluation of these two genes together may be useful for
      selecting patients for anti-EGFR-targeted therapy or anti-EGFR/AKT1-targeted
      therapy and for predicting outcomes.

AB  - Tumor collagen characteristics influence tumor malignancy, invasion, and
      metastasis. This study investigates the effects of trastuzumab (Tz) on the
      collagen of Tz-responsive (BT474) and Tz-resistant (HR6) breast cancer
      xenografts. Collagen content was assessed by in vivo second harmonic generation
      (SHG) imaging and histological trichrome staining of tumor sections. Collagen SHG
      imaging of control BT474 and HR6 tumors demonstrated increased collagen density
      after 14 days of treatment (p < 0.05). Trichrome staining revealed decreased
      collagen in Tz-treated BT474 and HR6 tumors at 2, 5, and 14 days of treatment,
      suggesting that Tz affects the tumor microenvironment independent of epithelial
      cell response. Additionally, collagen alignment analysis revealed significantly
      less aligned collagen in the Tz-treated BT474 tumors at day 14 compared with
      control BT474 tumors. There was no correlation between SHG endpoints (collagen
      density and alignment) and trichrome staining (p > 0.05), consistent with the
      physically distinctive nature of these measurements. There was also no
      correlation between tumor size and collagen endpoints (p > 0.05). These results
      identify changes within the collagen compartment of the tumor microenvironment
      following Tz treatment, which are independent from the tumor cell response to Tz,
      and demonstrate that intravital collagen SHG imaging is capable of measuring
      dynamic changes in tumor microenvironment following treatment that complements
      trichrome staining.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evidence regarding the outcomes of Hispanic women with breast
      cancer is lacking. We analyzed women with HER2+ disease treated with
      trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Mexico. METHODS: 244 patients were 
      included. Outcomes were compared between patients who achieved pathologic
      complete response (pCR) (n = 119), or less than pCR (n = 125). Patients with
      noninvasive (ypT0/is, ypN0) residual disease were also analyzed. RESULTS: 119
      (48.8%) patients achieved pCR. pCR was the only factor associated with improved 3
      year survival (98.1% vs 92.3%: P = 0.02). Survival was better in patients with
      ypT0/is, ypN0 response than in those with residual invasive disease (p < 0.01). 3
      year survival was 98.1% for patients with pCR and 92.6% for patients with ypTis, 
      ypN0 response (p = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Response rates to trastuzumab based
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Hispanics mimic that of other ethnic groups. This
      underlines the fact that access to treatment, rather than ethnicity, is the main 
      prognostic factor in this population.

TI  - An international study to increase concordance in Ki67 scoring.
PG  - 778-86
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2015.38 [doi]
AB  - Although an important biomarker in breast cancer, Ki67 lacks scoring
      standardization, which has limited its clinical use. Our previous study found
      variability when laboratories used their own scoring methods on centrally stained
      tissue microarray slides. In this current study, 16 laboratories from eight
      countries calibrated to a specific Ki67 scoring method and then scored 50
      centrally MIB-1 stained tissue microarray cases. Simple instructions prescribed
      scoring pattern and staining thresholds for determination of the percentage of
      stained tumor cells. To calibrate, laboratories scored 18 'training' and 'test'
      web-based images. Software tracked object selection and scoring. Success for the 
      calibration was prespecified as Root Mean Square Error of scores compared with
      reference <0.6 and Maximum Absolute Deviation from reference <1.0
      (log2-transformed data). Prespecified success criteria for tissue microarray
      scoring required intraclass correlation significantly >0.70 but aiming for
      observed intraclass correlation >/=0.90. Laboratory performance showed
      non-significant but promising trends of improvement through the calibration
      exercise (mean Root Mean Square Error decreased from 0.6 to 0.4, Maximum Absolute
      Deviation from 1.6 to 0.9; paired t-test: P=0.07 for Root Mean Square Error, 0.06
      for Maximum Absolute Deviation). For tissue microarray scoring, the intraclass
      correlation estimate was 0.94 (95% credible interval: 0.90-0.97), markedly and
      significantly >0.70, the prespecified minimum target for success. Some
      discrepancies persisted, including around clinically relevant cutoffs. After
      calibrating to a common scoring method via a web-based tool, laboratories can
      achieve high inter-laboratory reproducibility in Ki67 scoring on centrally
      stained tissue microarray slides. Although these data are potentially
      encouraging, suggesting that it may be possible to standardize scoring of Ki67
      among pathology laboratories, clinically important discrepancies persist. Before 
      this biomarker could be recommended for clinical use, future research will need
      to extend this approach to biopsies and whole sections, account for staining
      variability, and link to outcomes.

PG  - 6178
LID - 10.1038/ncomms7178 [doi]
AB  - Multiple regulatory elements distant from their targets on the linear genome can 
      influence the expression of a single gene through chromatin looping. Chromosome
      conformation capture implemented in Hi-C allows for genome-wide agnostic
      characterization of chromatin contacts. However, detection of functional
      enhancer-promoter interactions is precluded by its effective resolution that is
      determined by both restriction fragmentation and sensitivity of the experiment.
      Here we develop a capture Hi-C (cHi-C) approach to allow an agnostic
      characterization of these physical interactions on a genome-wide scale.
      Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with complex diseases often reside
      within regulatory elements and exert effects through long-range regulation of
      gene expression. Applying this cHi-C approach to 14 colorectal cancer risk loci
      allows us to identify key long-range chromatin interactions in cis and trans
      involving these loci.

      pectoralis major masquerading as a breast tumor: management and review of the
      literature.
PG  - 194-8
LID - 10.9738/INTSURG-D-13-00108.1 [doi]
AB  - Atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDL) of the
      pectoralis major muscle is an exceedingly rare clinical entity. We describe here 
      a case of intramuscular ALT/WDL of the pectoralis major muscle in a female
      patient who presented with clinical manifestations of a rapidly growing breast
      tumor. Diagnostic evaluation and management of the patient are discussed along
      with a review of the relevant literature. We conclude that although the clinical 
      examination may be inconclusive, the mammogram and especially the magnetic
      resonance imaging scan can precisely delineate the anatomic location and extent
      of the ALT/WDL of the pectoralis major muscle, thus allowing a correct
      preoperative diagnosis and adequate preoperative surgical planning. Complete
      resection is the treatment of choice for ALT/WDL. Long-term follow-up, however,
      remains mandatory because of the risk of local recurrence or delayed
      dedifferentiation.

TI  - Expression of autophagy-related proteins ATG5 and FIP200 predicts favorable
      disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer.

AB  - Autophagy is a self-digesting process that is primarily responsible for the
      removal and recycling of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles to maintain
      the homeostasis of the cell. Recent studies have indicated dual roles for
      autophagy in cancer: suppression of tumor progression and promotion of survival. 
      In this study, we sought to investigate the prognostic value of two
      autophagy-related proteins, autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) and FAK family
      kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), in patients with operable breast 
      cancer. More specifically, the expression of ATG5 and FIP200 was evaluated by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgical specimens collected from 200 patients who 
      were diagnosed with histologically proven invasive ductal breast cancer. A
      stepwise Cox multivariate analysis was then performed to construct a risk
      prediction model. In this retrospective cohort study, both ATG5 (HR = 0.465, 95% 
      CI 0.247-0.872, P = 0.017) and FIP200 (HR = 0.521, 95% CI 0.278-0.979, P = 0.043)
      correlated with prolonged disease-free survival (DFS). In a receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) analysis, the addition of ATG5 and FIP200 expression led to 
      a significantly improved area under the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) at 3 years
      (0.748 versus 0.680, P < 0.001) and 5 years (0.756 versus 0.699, P < 0.001).
      Collectively, our findings established the prognostic significance of ATG5 and
      FIP200 in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Checkpoint kinase1 (CHK1) is an important biomarker in breast cancer having a
      role in chemotherapy response.
PG  - 901-11
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Checkpoint kinase1 (CHK1), which is a key component of
      DNA-damage-activated checkpoint signalling response, may have a role in breast
      cancer (BC) pathogenesis and influence response to chemotherapy. This study
      investigated the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated CHK1 (pCHK1) 
      protein in BC. METHOD: pCHK1 protein expression was assessed using
      immunohistochemistry in a large, well-characterized annotated series of
      early-stage primary operable invasive BC prepared as tissue microarray (n=1200). 
      RESULT: pCHK1 showed nuclear and/or cytoplasmic expression. Tumours with nuclear 
      expression showed positive associations with favourable prognostic features such 
      as lower grade, lower mitotic activity, expression of hormone receptor and lack
      of expression of KI67 and PI3K (P<0.001). On the other hand, cytoplasmic
      expression was associated with features of poor prognosis such as higher grade,
      triple-negative phenotype and expression of KI67, p53, AKT and PI3K. pCHK1
      expression showed an association with DNA damage response (ATM, RAD51, BRCA1,
      KU70/KU80, DNA-PKCalpha and BARD1) and sumoylation (UBC9 and PIASgamma)
      biomarkers. Subcellular localisation of pCHK1 was associated with the expression 
      of the nuclear transport protein KPNA2. Positive nuclear expression predicted
      better survival outcome in patients who did not receive chemotherapy in the whole
      series and in ER-positive tumours. In ER-negative and triple-negative subgroups, 
      nuclear pCHK1 predicted shorter survival in patients who received
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-florouracil chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      data suggest that pCHK1 may have prognostic and predictive significance in BC.
      Subcellular localisation of pCHK1 protein is related to its function.

AB  - A polymeric prodrug of cisplatin (CP) with simple chemical structure was
      synthesized based on pullulan and its therapeutic effects on human hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) were studied in vitro and in vivo. Briefly, CP was linked to
      pullulan monosuccinate (SUPA) via coordination bond to form prodrug of CP-SUPA
      with the CP weight content of 18.7%. CP-SUPA exhibited in vitro sustained
      releases and strong interactions with genomic DNA. CP-SUPA could effectively
      inhibit the proliferation of HCC HepG2 cells by promoting the cell apoptosis and 
      arresting the cell cycle, and showed a significantly higher cytotoxicity on HepG2
      cells than that on human lung epithelial A549 cells. Compared to free CP, CP-SUPA
      obviously prolonged the survival times of Balb/c mice after intravenous injection
      at CP doses of 15 and 30 mumol/kg, and no signs of toxic effects in main tissues 
      were detected by histologic examination. In MHCC-97H tumor-bearing nude mice,
      CP-SUPA was mainly distributed in the liver and the tumor after 24h post
      administration and evidently inhibited the tumor growth at CP doses of 3.5 and
      7.0 mumol/kg. In conclusion, CP-SUPA was an ideal candidate of polymeric prodrug 
      for the targeted therapy against HCC.

AB  - We used a loss-of-function screen to investigate the role of classical
      protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in three-dimensional mammary epithelial cell
      morphogenesis and ERBB2 signaling. The study revealed a novel role for PTPD2 as a
      positive regulator of ERBB2 signaling. Suppression of PTPD2 attenuated the
      ERBB2-induced multiacinar phenotype in three-dimensional cultures specifically by
      inhibiting ERBB2-mediated loss of polarity and lumen filling. In contrast,
      overexpression of PTPD2 enhanced the ERBB2 phenotype. We also found that a lipid 
      second messenger, phosphatidic acid, bound PTPD2 in vitro and enhanced its
      catalytic activity. Small molecule inhibitors of phospholipase D (PLD), an enzyme
      that produces phosphatidic acid in cells, also attenuated the ERBB2 phenotype.
      Exogenously added phosphatidic acid rescued the PLD-inhibition phenotype, but
      only when PTPD2 was present. These findings illustrate a novel pathway involving 
      PTPD2 and the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid that promotes ERBB2
      function.

TI  - Expression of cyclin kinase subunit 2 in human breast cancer and its prognostic
      significance.
PG  - 8593-601
AB  - Cyclin kinase subunit 2 (CKS2) protein is a small cyclin-dependent
      kinase-interacting protein, which is essential for the first metaphase/anaphase
      transition of mammalian meiosis. CKS2 is up-regulated in various malignancies,
      suggesting that CKS2 maybe an oncogene. However, data on its expression pattern
      and clinical relevance in breast cancer are unknown. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate CKS2 expression and its prognostic significance in breast cancer. The
      CKS2 expression was examined at mRNA and protein levels by real-time quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis in paired breast
      cancer tissues and the adjacent normal tissues. The expression of CKS2 protein in
      126 specimens of breast cancer was determined by immunohistochemistry assay. The 
      relations between CKS2 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed.
      The result show the expression of CKS2 mRNA and protein was higher in breast
      cancer than the adjacent normal tissues. Compared with adjacent normal breast
      tissues, Overexpression of CKS2 was detected in 56.3% (71/126) patients.
      Overexpression of CKS2 was significantly associated with large tumor size (P =
      0.035), poor cellular differentiation (P = 0.016), lack expression of
      progesterone receptor (P = 0.006), and decreased overall survival (P = 0.001). In
      multivariate analysis, CKS2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for
      overall survival (Hazard ratio [HR] = 3.404, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.482-7.818; P = 0.004). CKS2 is up-regulated in breast cancer and associated
      with large tumor size, lack expression of progesterone receptor, poor tumor
      differentiation and survival. CKS2 may serve as a good prognostic indicator for
      patients with breast cancer.

AB  - Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) constitutes a heterogeneous entity that
      includes advanced-stage primary tumours, cancers with extensive nodal involvement
      and inflammatory breast carcinomas. Although the definition of LABC can be
      broadened to include some large operable breast tumours, we use this term to
      strictly refer to inoperable cancers that are included in the above-mentioned
      categories. The prognosis of such tumours is often unfavourable; despite
      aggressive treatment, many patients eventually develop distant metastases and die
      from the disease. Advances in systemic therapy, including radiation treatment,
      surgical techniques and the development of new targeted agents have significantly
      improved clinical outcomes for patients with this disease. Notwithstanding these 
      advances, LABC remains an important clinical problem, particularly in developing 
      countries and those without widely adapted breast cancer awareness programmes.
      The optimal management of LABC requires a multidisciplinary approach, a
      well-coordinated treatment schedule and close cooperation between medical,
      surgical and radiation oncologists. In this Review, we discuss the current state 
      of the art and possible future treatment strategies for patients with LABC.

TI  - Human papillomavirus and breast cancer: no evidence of association in a Spanish
      set of cases.
PG  - 851-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Great controversy exists about the association between Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV) and breast tumors. The aim of this study was to explore the 
      presence of HPV DNA in a large set of breast cancer cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Techniques used followed the standards for an international retrospective survey 
      of HPV-DNA genotyping, coordinated by our own group and the DDL Laboratories in
      Rijswijk, the Netherlands. Paraffin-embedded samples were used. SPF-10
      broad-spectrum primers were applied, followed by deoxyribonucleic acid enzyme
      immunoassay and genotyping by reverse-line probe assay. RESULTS: A total of 78
      samples were included in the study, 2 of benign conditions and 76 carcinomas,
      including different histological subtypes. HPV was not present in any of the
      specimens studied irrespective of histology, hormonal status and stage of
      disease. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the involvement of HPV in breast
      carcinogenesis as no evidence of its presence was found.

AB  - This overview reports published data about the interaction between physical
      activity and sport during and after cancer on one hand and improvement in
      psychological parameters, survival and biological mechanisms underlying this
      effect on the other hand. Practising physical activity and sport during cancer
      modifies parameters assessing fatigue and quality of life and reduces symptoms of
      depression. An association also exists between the practise of physical activity 
      and sport and overall and cancer-specific survivals, especially after breast
      cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. These benefits seem to be mediated by a
      modification of circulating levels of estrogens, insulin, IGF-1 and by a decrease
      in insulin-resistance, by alterations in the secretion of adipokines, and by a
      reduction in chronic inflammation through decreased levels of cytokines. There
      exist some obstacles to the practise of physical activity. These obstacles are
      mainly related to a fear of pain induced by physical activity and to overweight. 
      These programmes of physical activity and sport cannot be offered to all patients
      since there are several contra-indications, with some being present since the
      initial visit and others appearing during cancer management either due to disease
      progression or related to iatrogenic effects. Whereas benefits from physical
      activity and sport among cancer patients seem obvious, there are still several
      pending clinical and biological issues.

TI  - Ethnic differences in mammographic densities: an Asian cross-sectional study.
PG  - e0117568
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0117568 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer and is
      highly variable, but, to date, few studies have examined density in Asian women, 
      particularly those in low and middle-income Asian countries where genetic and
      lifestyle determinants may be significantly different. METHODS: A total of 1,240 
      women who attended an opportunistic mammogram screening programme were eligible
      for analysis. Mammographic density was estimated using a fully-automated
      thresholding method and differences across ethnic groups were examined using
      linear regression in 205 randomly selected Chinese women, 138 Malay and 199
      Indian women. RESULTS: Percent density was significantly higher in Chinese women 
      (28.5%; 95% CI 27.0%, 30.0%) compared to Malay (24.2%; 95% CI 22.5%, 26.0%) and
      Indian (24.3%; 95% CI 22.8%, 25.7%) women (p<0.001), after adjustment for age,
      BMI, menopausal status, parity and age at first full term pregnancy.
      Correspondingly, adjusted nondense area was significantly lower in Chinese
      (72.2cm2; 95% CI 67.9cm2, 76.5cm2) women compared to Malay (92.1cm2; 95% CI
      86.9cm2, 97.2cm2) and Indian (97.7cm2; 95% CI 93.4cm2, 101.9cm2) women (p<0.001),
      but dense area did not differ across the three ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study shows that higher percent density and lower nondense area reflect the
      higher incidence of breast cancer in Chinese compared to Malay and Indian women
      in Malaysia. Known lifestyle determinants of mammographic density do not fully
      account for the ethnic variations observed in mammographic density in this Asian 
      cohort.

TI  - The WNT-controlled transcriptional regulator LBH is required for mammary stem
      cell expansion and maintenance of the basal lineage.
PG  - 893-904
LID - 10.1242/dev.110403 [doi]
AB  - The identification of multipotent mammary stem cells (MaSCs) has provided an
      explanation for the unique regenerative capacity of the mammary gland throughout 
      adult life. However, it remains unclear what genes maintain MaSCs and control
      their specification into the two epithelial lineages: luminal and basal. LBH is a
      novel transcription co-factor in the WNT pathway with hitherto unknown
      physiological function. LBH is expressed during mammary gland development and
      aberrantly overexpressed in aggressive 'basal' subtype breast cancers. Here, we
      have explored the in vivo role of LBH in mammopoiesis. We show that in postnatal 
      mammary epithelia, LBH is predominantly expressed in the Lin(-)CD29(high)CD24(+) 
      basal MaSC population. Upon conditional inactivation of LBH, mice exhibit
      pronounced delays in mammary tissue expansion during puberty and pregnancy,
      accompanied by increased luminal differentiation at the expense of basal lineage 
      specification. These defects could be traced to a severe reduction in the
      frequency and self-renewal/differentiation potential of basal MaSCs.
      Mechanistically, LBH induces expression of key epithelial stem cell transcription
      factor DeltaNp63 to promote a basal MaSC state and repress luminal
      differentiation genes, mainly that encoding estrogen receptor alpha
      (Esr1/ERalpha). Collectively, these studies identify LBH as an essential
      regulator of basal MaSC expansion/maintenance, raising important implications for
      its potential role in breast cancer pathogenesis.

TI  - The Value of Ki67 in Very Young Women with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast
      Cancer: Retrospective Analysis of 9,321 Korean Women.
PG  - 3481-8
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4399-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Young breast cancer patients have a poorer prognosis, especially when
      their tumors are hormone receptor positive. We analyzed the association between
      Ki67 and age and the impact of these factors on outcomes in hormone
      receptor-positive breast cancer. METHODS: The records of 9,321 hormone
      receptor-positive invasive breast cancer patients from three large centers were
      retrospectively reviewed. Each institution separately assayed Ki67 level
      immunohistochemically. Univariate and multivariate analysis for recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) was performed on 4,738 patients from a single center. RESULTS:
      Ki67 level was inversely proportional to age in all three data sets and was
      significantly higher for younger patients (p < 0.001, 0.03, and <0.001,
      respectively). This correlation was seen only in the human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative population. Survival analysis showed that both 
      very young age (<35 years) and high Ki67 level (>/=10 %) were independent
      prognostic factors. Although young age was a worse prognostic indicator
      regardless of HER2 status, Ki67 index was associated with worse prognosis only in
      HER2-negative patients. When patients were stratified into those with low and
      high Ki67, young age remained a significant factor for RFS, with hazard ratios in
      these two Ki67 groups of 2.15 and 2.57, respectively (p < 0.001). Also, the young
      age/low Ki67 group had significantly poorer RFS than the older age/high Ki67
      group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ki67 level was higher in younger patients.
      However, very young patients had a poorer prognosis regardless of Ki67 level.
      Unknown biologic factors other than high cell proliferation might play a role in 
      the aggressiveness of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in very young
      patients.

TI  - Disparities in breast cancer surgery delay: the lingering effect of race.
PG  - 2902-11
LID - 10.1245/s10434-015-4397-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delays to surgical breast cancer treatment of 90 days or more may be 
      associated with greater stage migration. We investigated racial disparities in
      time to receiving first surgical treatment in breast cancer patients. METHODS:
      Insured black (56 %) and white (44 %) women with primary breast cancer completed 
      telephone interviews regarding psychosocial (e.g., self-efficacy) and health care
      factors (e.g., communication). Clinical data were extracted from medical charts. 
      Time to surgery was measured as the days between diagnosis and definitive
      surgical treatment. We also examined delays of more than 90 days. Unadjusted
      hazard ratios (HRs) examined univariate relationships between delay outcomes and 
      covariates. Cox proportional hazard models were used for multivariate analyses.
      RESULTS: Mean time to surgery was higher in blacks (mean 47 days) than whites
      (mean 33 days; p = .001). Black women were less likely to receive therapy before 
      90 days compared to white women after adjustment for covariates (HR .58; 95 %
      confidence interval .44, .78). Health care process factors were nonsignificant in
      multivariate models. Women with shorter delay reported Internet use (vs. not) and
      underwent breast-conserving surgery (vs. mastectomy) (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Prolonged delays to definitive breast cancer surgery persist among black women.
      Because the 90-day interval has been associated with poorer outcomes,
      interventions to address delay are needed.

TI  - Interaction between p53 mutation and a somatic HDMX biomarker better defines
      metastatic potential in breast cancer.
PG  - 698-708
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2637 [doi]
AB  - TP53 gene mutation is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, but
      additional biomarkers that can further refine the impact of the p53 pathway are
      needed to achieve clinical utility. In this study, we evaluated a role for the
      HDMX-S/FL ratio as one such biomarker, based on its association with other
      suppressor mutations that confer worse prognosis in sarcomas, another type of
      cancer that is surveilled by p53. We found that HDMX-S/FL ratio interacted with
      p53 mutational status to significantly improve prognostic capability in patients 
      with breast cancer. This biomarker pair offered prognostic utility that was
      comparable with a microarray-based prognostic assay. Unexpectedly, the utility
      tracked independently of DNA-damaging treatments and instead with different tumor
      metastasis potential. Finally, we obtained evidence that this biomarker pair
      might identify patients who could benefit from anti-HDM2 strategies to impede
      metastatic progression. Taken together, our work offers a p53 pathway marker,
      which both refines our understanding of the impact of p53 activity on prognosis
      and harbors potential utility as a clinical tool.

TI  - Impact of mammographic screening on ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in breast
      cancer stage at diagnosis and survival in New Zealand: a cohort study.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s12889-015-1383-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indigenous Maori women experience a 60% higher breast cancer
      mortality rate compared with European women in New Zealand. We explored the
      impact of differences in rates of screen detected breast cancer on inequities in 
      cancer stage at diagnosis and survival between Maori and NZ European women.
      METHODS: All primary breast cancers diagnosed in screening age women (as defined 
      by the New Zealand National Breast Cancer Screening Programme) during 1999-2012
      in the Waikato area (n = 1846) were identified from the Waikato Breast Cancer
      Register and the National Screening Database. Stage at diagnosis and survival
      were compared for screen detected (n = 1106) and non-screen detected (n = 740)
      breast cancer by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Indigenous Maori
      women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with more advanced cancer
      compared with NZ European women (OR = 1.51), and approximately a half of this
      difference was explained by lower rate of screen detected cancer for Maori women.
      For non-screen detected cancer, Maori had significantly lower 10-year breast
      cancer survival compared with NZ European (46.5% vs. 73.2%) as did most deprived 
      compared with most affluent socioeconomic quintiles (64.8% vs. 81.1%). No
      significant survival differences were observed for screen detected cancer by
      ethnicity or socioeconomic deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The lower rate of screen
      detected breast cancer appears to be a key contributor towards the higher rate of
      advanced cancer at diagnosis and lower breast cancer survival for Maori compared 
      with NZ European women. Among women with screen-detected breast cancer, Maori
      women do just as well as NZ European women, demonstrating the success of breast
      screening for Maori women who are able to access screening. Increasing breast
      cancer screening rates has the potential to improve survival for Maori women and 
      reduce breast cancer survival inequity between Maori and NZ European women.

TI  - Cardiac protective effects of dexrazoxane on animal cardiotoxicity model induced 
      by anthracycline combined with trastuzumab is associated with upregulation of
      calpain-2.
PG  - e445
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000445 [doi]
AB  - Cardiotoxicity is a well-recognized side effect induced by chemotherapeutic drugs
      such as anthracycline and trastuzumab through different mechanisms. Currently,
      accumulating evidence supports that dexrazoxane (DZR) can minimize the risk of
      cardiotoxicity. In this study, we investigated whether dexrzoxane could reduce
      cardiotoxicity in the treatment of anthracycline combined with trastuzumab. We
      randomly divided 90 experimental F344 rats into control group, chemotherapeutics 
      and trastuzumab (doxorubicin [DOX] + herceptin [Her]) group, and
      chemotherapeutics, trastuzumab, and DZR (DOX + Her + DZR) group. Animal status
      and body weight, cardiac function, serum cardiac markers, cardiomyocyte apoptosis
      of the rats, and expression level of calpain-2 were evaluated. Left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS) of the left ventricle
      were observed. The serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and cardiac troponin I
      (cTnI) and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent
      assay and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays. The mRNA and protein level 
      of calpain-2 were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and
      Western blot. We observed that the LVEF and FS of the left ventricle were
      significantly higher in the DOX + Her + DZR group than that in the DOX + Her
      group (P < 0.05). The serum levels of MDA and cTnI between DOX + Her group and
      DOX + Her + DZR group were significantly different. In addition, cardiomyocyte
      apoptosis in the DOX + Her + DZR group was significantly less severe than that in
      the DOX + Her group (P < 0.05). After DZR treatment, the calpain-2 mRNA and
      protein levels in the DOX + Her + DZR group were significantly higher than the
      DOX + Her group (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that DZR can effectively reduce
      the cardiotoxicity of combinatorial treatment of trastuzumab and anthracycline
      partly through upregulating calpain-2.

AB  - The translation of basic research into improved therapies for breast cancer
      patients requires relevant preclinical models that incorporate spontaneous
      metastasis. We have completed a functional and molecular characterisation of a
      new isogenic C57BL/6 mouse model of breast cancer metastasis, comparing and
      contrasting it with the established BALB/c 4T1 model. Metastatic EO771.LMB
      tumours were derived from poorly metastatic parental EO771 mammary tumours.
      Functional differences were evaluated using both in vitro assays and spontaneous 
      metastasis assays in mice. Results were compared to non-metastatic 67NR and
      metastatic 4T1.2 tumours of the 4T1 model. Protein and transcript levels of
      markers of human breast cancer molecular subtypes were measured in the four
      tumour lines, as well as p53 (Tp53) tumour-suppressor gene status and responses
      to tamoxifen in vivo and in vitro. Array-based expression profiling of whole
      tumours identified genes and pathways that were deregulated in metastatic
      tumours. EO771.LMB cells metastasised spontaneously to lung in C57BL/6 mice and
      displayed increased invasive capacity compared with parental EO771. By
      immunohistochemical assessment, EO771 and EO771.LMB were basal-like, as was the
      4T1.2 tumour, whereas 67NR had a luminal phenotype. Primary tumours from all
      lines were negative for progesterone receptor, Erb-b2/Neu and cytokeratin 5/6,
      but positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Only 67NR displayed
      nuclear estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positivity. EO771 and EO771.LMB
      expressed mutant p53, whereas 67NR and 4T1.2 were p53-null. Integrated molecular 
      analysis of both the EO771/EO771.LMB and 67NR/4T1.2 pairs indicated that
      upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), parathyroid hormone-like
      hormone (Pthlh) and S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100a8) and downregulation
      of the thrombospondin receptor (Cd36) might be causally involved in metastatic
      dissemination of breast cancer.

TI  - Challenging a traditional paradigm: 12-year experience with autologous free flap 
      breast reconstruction for inflammatory breast cancer.
PG  - 262e-9e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000000900 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare but aggressive breast cancer
      with an overall poor prognosis. Traditionally, reconstruction has not been
      offered, because of poor long-term survival, the need for multimodality
      treatment, and complex treatment sequencing. The authors examined the safety and 
      feasibility of free flap breast reconstruction for inflammatory breast cancer.
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent reconstruction
      for inflammatory breast cancer from January of 2000 to December of 2012 was
      conducted. RESULTS: Of 830 inflammatory breast cancer patients, 59 (7.1 percent; 
      median age, 48 years; range, 27 to 65 years) underwent free flap reconstruction. 
      All patients received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Most patients (n = 52) 
      underwent delayed reconstruction. Five patients with a history of prior partial
      mastectomy and irradiation developed inflammatory breast cancer and underwent
      immediate reconstruction following completion mastectomy. Two others underwent
      immediate chest wall and breast reconstruction following resection. Thirteen
      patients underwent bilateral reconstruction, and seven required a bipedicled
      abdominal flap for the unilateral mastectomy defect. Thirty-seven patients (62.7 
      percent) required revision of the reconstructed breast, and 29 (49.2 percent) had
      a contralateral balancing procedure to optimize symmetry. Complications occurred 
      in 21 patients (35.6 percent), with one total flap loss (1.7 percent). The median
      length of follow-up was 43.9 months; 49 patients (83.1 percent) were alive
      without evidence of recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous free flap breast
      reconstruction can be performed safely in inflammatory breast cancer patients,
      with acceptable complication rates and without an increased risk for flap loss.
      Inflammatory breast cancer should not preclude free flap breast reconstruction.

TI  - New cell culture model for aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancer shows
      sensitivity to fulvestrant treatment and cross-resistance between letrozole and
      exemestane.
PG  - 1481-90
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.2850 [doi]
AB  - Aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment is first-line systemic treatment for the
      majority of postmenopausal breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive primary tumor. Although many patients benefit from treatment, some 
      will develop resistance, and models mimicking acquired resistance will be
      valuable tools to unravel the resistance mechanisms and to find new treatments
      and biomarkers. Cell culture models for acquired resistance to the three
      clinically relevant AIs letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane were developed by
      selection and expansion of colonies of MCF-7 breast cancer cells surviving
      long-term AI treatment under conditions where endogenous aromatase-mediated
      conversion of androgen to estrogen was required for growth. Four cell lines
      resistant to each of the AIs were established and characterized. Maintenance of
      ER expression and function was a general finding, but ER loss was seen in one of 
      twelve cell lines. HER receptor expression was increased, in particular EGFR
      expression in letrozole-resistant cell lines. The AI-resistant cell lines had
      acquired ability to grow without aromatase-mediated conversion of testosterone to
      estradiol, but upon withdrawal of AI treatment, testosterone induced minor growth
      stimulation. Letrozole, exemestane and tamoxifen were able to abrogate the
      testosterone stimulation but could not reduce growth to below the level in
      standard growth medium with AI, demonstrating cross-resistance between letrozole,
      exemestane and tamoxifen. In contrast, fulvestrant totally blocked growth of the 
      AI resistant cell lines both after withdrawal of AI and with AI treatment. These 
      data show that ER is the main driver of growth of the AI-resistant cell lines and
      indicate ligand-independent activation of ER. Fulvestrant is an efficient
      treatment option for these AI-resistant breast cancer cells, and the cell lines
      will be useful tools to disclose the underlying molecular mechanism for
      resistance to the different AIs.

TI  - Current management of lesions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
PG  - 227-38
LID - 10.1038/nrclinonc.2015.8 [doi]
AB  - High-risk breast lesions, which comprise benign lesions and in situ carcinomas
      (lobular carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ), are clinically,
      morphologically, and biologically heterogeneous and are associated with an
      increased risk of invasive breast cancer development, albeit to varying degrees. 
      Recognition and proactive management of such lesions can help to prevent
      progression to invasive disease, and might, therefore, reduce breast cancer
      incidence, morbidity, and mortality. However, this opportunity comes with the
      possibility of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, necessitating risk-based
      intervention. Notably, despite the progress in defining the molecular changes
      associated with carcinogenesis, alterations identifying the individuals with
      high-risk lesions that will progress to invasive carcinoma remain to be
      identified. Thus, until reproducible clinicopathological or molecular features
      predicting an individual's risk of breast cancer are found, management strategies
      must be defined by population-level risks as determined by models such as the
      Gail or IBIS models, as well as patient attitudes toward the risks and benefits
      of interventions. Herein, we review the contemporary approaches to diagnosis and 
      management of high-risk breast lesions. Progress in this area will ultimately be 
      dependent on the ability to individualize risk prediction through better
      definition of the key drivers in the carcinogenic process.

TI  - Functional consequence of the MET-T1010I polymorphism in breast cancer.
PG  - 2604-14
AB  - Major breast cancer predisposition genes, only account for approximately 30% of
      high-risk breast cancer families and only explain 15% of breast cancer familial
      relative risk. The HGF growth factor receptor MET is potentially functionally
      altered due to an uncommon germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
      MET-T1010I, in many cancer lineages including breast cancer where the MET-T1010I 
      SNP is present in 2% of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Expression of
      MET-T1010I in the context of mammary epithelium increases colony formation, cell 
      migration and invasion in-vitro and tumor growth and invasion in-vivo. A
      selective effect of MET-T1010I as compared to wild type MET on cell invasion both
      in-vitro and in-vivo suggests that the MET-T1010I SNP may alter tumor
      pathophysiology and should be considered as a potential biomarker when
      implementing MET targeted clinical trials.

AB  - The present study aimed at evaluating and comparing the diagnostic performance of
      B-mode ultrasound (US), elastography score (ES), and strain ratio (SR) for the
      differentiation of breast lesions. This retrospective study enrolled 431 lesions 
      from 417 in-hospital patients. All patients were examined with both conventional 
      ultrasound and elastography. Two experienced radiologists reviewed ultrasound and
      elasticity images. The histopathologic result obtained from ultrasound-guided
      core biopsy or operation excisions were used as the reference standard.
      Pathologic examination revealed 276 malignant lesions (64%) and 155 benign
      lesions (36%). A cut-off point of 4.15 (area under the curve, 0.891) allowed
      significant differentiation of malignant and benign lesions. ROC
      (receiver-operating characteristic) curves showed a higher value for combination 
      of B-mode ultrasound and elastography for the diagnosis of breast lesions.
      Conventional ultrasound combined elastography showed high sensitivity,
      specificity, and accuracy for group II lesions (10mm<lesion diameter </=20mm).
      Elastography combined with conventional ultrasound show high specificity and
      accuracy for differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions. Elastography
      is particularly important for the diagnosis of BI-RADS 4 and small breast
      lesions.

TI  - Correlation between mammograghic findings and clinical/ pathologic features in
      women with small invasive breast carcinomas.
PG  - 10643-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the relationship between mammographic findings and
      clinical/pathologic features in women with 1-15mm sized invasive breast cancer.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated a consecutive series of 134 cases
      diagnosed in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital in 2007.
      Mammographic findings were classified into five groups as follows :1) stellate
      mass without calcification; 2) non-stellate mass without calcification; 3)
      intermediate suspicious calcification with or without associated mass; 4) higher 
      probability malignant calcification with or without associated mass; 5) focal
      asymmetry/distortion without associated calcification. Associations between
      mammographic and clinical/pathological features (menopause status/family
      history/histologic grade/lymph node status and ER/PR/HER2 status) was analyzed
      through logistic regression and chi square tests. RESULTS: Compared to the
      stellate mass without calcification group, higher probability malignant
      calcification patients were associated significantly with a positive lymph node
      status, always presenting in patients who were non-menopausal and with a family
      history of carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Higher probability malignant calcifications
      with or without associated tumor masses are associated with clinical/pathologic
      features of poor prognosis.

TI  - Standard versus continuous administration of capecitabine in metastatic breast
      cancer (GEICAM/2009-05): a randomized, noninferiority phase II trial with a
      pharmacogenetic analysis.
PG  - 111-2
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0379 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The approved capecitabine regimen as monotherapy in metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) is 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily for 2 weeks on and 1 week off (Cint).
      Dose modifications are often required because of severe hand-foot syndrome (HFS).
      We tested a continuous regimen with a lower daily dose but a similar cumulative
      dose in an attempt to reduce the severity of adverse events (AEs) while
      maintaining efficacy. METHODS: We randomized 195 patients with HER-2/neu-negative
      MBC to capecitabine 800 mg/m(2) twice daily throughout the 21-day cycle (Ccont)
      or to Cint to assess noninferiority in the percentage of patients free of
      progression at 1 year. Secondary endpoints included efficacy and safety.
      Associations between polymorphisms in capecitabine metabolism-related genes and
      drug response were assessed. RESULTS: The percentage of patients free of
      progression at 1 year was 27.3% with Cint versus 25.3% with Ccont (difference of 
      -2.0%; 95% confidence interval: -15.5% to 11.5%, exceeding the 15% deemed
      noninferior). Differences regarding other efficacy variables were also not found.
      Grade 3-4 HFS was the most frequent AE (41.1% in Cint vs. 42.3% in Ccont). Grade 
      3-4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and stomatitis were more frequent
      with Cint. A 5' untranslated region polymorphism in the carboxylesterase 2 gene
      was associated with HFS. One polymorphism in cytidine deaminase and two in
      thymidine phosphorylase were associated with survival. CONCLUSION: Our study was 
      unable to show noninferiority with the continuous capecitabine regimen (Ccont)
      compared with the approved intermittent regimen (Cint). Further investigation is 
      required to improve HFS. Polymorphisms in several genes might contribute to
      interindividual differences in response to capecitabine.

PG  - 13-20
LID - 10.3109/15569527.2014.1003267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present cross-sectional study has the purpose to investigate the 
      impact of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
      thickness, optic nerve and macular function in patients using AIs for breast
      cancer treatment. METHODS: Participants in our study were 41
      hormone-receptor-positive earlystage breast cancer patients who were treated with
      AIs in the adjuvant setting. Moreover, 40 age- and gender-matched control
      subjects, having neither ocular nor systemic disorders, were included in this
      study. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination,
      including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment, RNFL thickness and
      central foveal thickness (CFT) measurement, visual evoked potentials (VEP)
      recording and multifocal-electroretinogram (mf-ERG) recording. Univariate and
      multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: At the multiple regression 
      analyses, patients receiving AIs presented with lower average RNFL and inferior
      RNFL. Moreover, similarly to the univariate analysis, intake of AIs was
      associated with lower amplitude P100, lower retinal response density in ring 1
      and ring 2, longer peak time P100 and longer P1 time in ring 1. CONCLUSION: Our
      study is the first in the literature investigating the potential effect of AIs on
      RNFL thickness, optic nerve and macular function in patients using AIs for breast
      cancer treatment. The principal message of our study is that patients using AIs
      exhibited a significant decrease in RNFL thickness (average, superior and
      inferior), retinal response density and visual acuity compared to healthy
      controls, while VEP findings (both amplitude and peak time of P100) differ
      significantly as well.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify predictors of changes in diurnal cortisol
      patterns during the 8-month follow up period for young breast cancer survivors.
      Among the potential predictors were tumor size, lymph node metastasis, changes in
      sleep problems, habitual time of awakening and bedtime, physical activity levels,
      body mass index (BMI), and depressive levels across 8 months. METHODS: The
      participants were 62 breast cancer women who were aged 40 years and below, and
      had completed active breast cancer treatment. The longitudinal data were
      collected at four points: baseline assessment (T0) and three follow-ups after
      baseline: T1 (in the 2nd month), T2 (in the 5th month), and T3 (in the 8th
      month). The participants collected their salivary cortisol at home at six time
      points: upon waking, 30 and 45min after waking, and at 1200h, 1700h, and 2100h.
      They also completed several questionnaires: the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep
      scale; the Beck Depression Inventory-II, physical activity levels on a 10-point
      scale, time of going to bed, time of awakening, and total sleep hours. RESULTS:
      This study found that the main predictors of changes toward flatter diurnal
      cortisol patterns during the 8-month follow ups were greater tumor sizes,
      increases of BMI scores, and habitually later times of awakening. CONCLUSIONS:
      While greater tumor sizes represent biological vulnerability of disruption of
      cortisol circadian rhythm, maintaining an appropriate BMI and good sleep habits
      could be a protective factor for normal cortisol regulation, which likely helps
      to reduce early mortality in young breast cancer survivors.

LID - 10.3892/mmr.2015.3195 [doi]
AB  - Since the identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) a new understanding of tumor
      occurrence and development has evolved. According to the stem cell (SC) theory,
      colorectal carcinoma (CRC) SCs may be derived from mutations in normal intestinal
      cells. CSCs can be defined by their cell of origin (SCs or early progenitor
      cells). Thus, through a shared stem cell marker between CSCs and SCs, it is
      possible to investigate the association between its expression and the various
      clinicopathological features in patients with CRC. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
      (ALDH1) is an appropriate marker. The present study was performed to examine the 
      role of ALDH1 in CRC. Through indirect fluorescence antibody staining, the
      association between ALDH1 protein expression and various clinicopathological
      parameters was investigated. Furthermore, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA) was used to investigate the differing content of ALDH1 between CRC
      tissues and normal colorectal tissues. The results revealed that ALDH1 expression
      was markedly associated with tumor stage, Dukes' stage and the level of tumor
      cell differentiation. Using ELISA, it was demonstrated that there was a greater
      level of ALDH1 in CRC tissue than in normal colorectal tissue. Therefore, ALDH1
      levels can be used as a useful parameter for pathological evaluation of tissue
      histology and to predict disease prognosis.

TI  - Blinded double reading yields a higher programme sensitivity than non-blinded
      double reading at digital screening mammography: a prospected population based
      study in the south of The Netherlands.

AB  - PURPOSE: To prospectively determine the screening mammography outcome at blinded 
      and non-blinded double reading in a biennial population based screening programme
      in the south of the Netherlands. METHODS: We included a consecutive series of
      87,487 digital screening mammograms, obtained between July 2009 and July 2011.
      Screening mammograms were double read in either a blinded (2nd reader was not
      informed about the 1st reader's decision) or non-blinded fashion (2nd reader was 
      informed about the 1st reader's decision). This reading strategy was alternated
      on a monthly basis. Women with discrepant readings between the two radiologists
      were always referred for further analysis. During 2 years follow-up, we collected
      the radiology reports, surgical correspondence and pathology reports of all
      referred women and interval breast cancers. RESULTS: Respectively 44,491 and
      42,996 screens had been read either in a blinded or non-blinded fashion. Referral
      rate (3.3% versus 2.8%, p<0.001) and false positive rate (2.6% versus 2.2%,
      p=0.002) were significantly higher at blinded double reading whereas the cancer
      detection rate per 1000 screens (7.4 versus 6.5, p=0.14) and positive predictive 
      value of referral (22% versus 23%, p=0.51) were comparable. Blinded double
      reading resulted in a significantly higher programme sensitivity (83% versus 76%,
      p=0.01). Per 1000 screened women, blinded double reading would yield 0.9 more
      screen detected cancers and 0.6 less interval cancers than non-blinded double
      reading, at the expense of 4.4 more recalls. CONCLUSION: We advocate the use of
      blinded double reading in order to achieve a better programme sensitivity, at the
      expense of an increased referral rate and false positive referral rate.

TI  - Circulating tumor cells in newly diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/s13058-014-0507-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are an independent prognostic factor
      for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one of the most
      aggressive forms of breast cancer. The prognostic value of a CTC count in newly
      diagnosed IBC has not been established. The aim of this study was to assess the
      prognostic value of a baseline CTC count in patients with newly diagnosed IBC.
      METHODS: This retrospective study included 147 patients with newly diagnosed IBC 
      (77 with locally advanced and 70 with metastatic IBC) treated with neoadjuvant
      therapy or first-line chemotherapy during the period from January 2004 through
      December 2012 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. CTCs were
      detected and enumerated by using the CellSearch system before patients were
      started with chemotherapy. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with >/=1 CTC was 
      lower among patients with stage III than among patients with metastatic IBC
      (54.5% versus 84.3%; P=0.0002); the proportion of patients with >/=5 CTCs was
      also lower for stage III than for metastatic IBC (19.5% versus 47.1%; P=0.0004). 
      Patients with fewer than five CTCs had significantly better progression-free
      survival (PFS) (hazard ratio (HR)=0.60; P=0.02) and overall survival (HR=0.59;
      P=0.03) than patients with five or more CTCs. Among patients with stage III IBC, 
      there was a nonsignificant difference in PFS (HR=0.66; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 0.31 to 1.39; P=0.29) and OS (HR=0.54; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.26; P=0.48) in
      patients with no CTCs compared with patients with one or more CTCs. In
      multivariate analysis, CTC was prognostic for PFS and OS independent of clinical 
      stage. CONCLUSIONS: CTCs can be detected in a large proportion of patients with
      newly diagnosed IBC and are a strong predictor of worse prognosis in patients
      with newly diagnosed IBC.

TI  - The cylindromatosis gene product, CYLD, interacts with MIB2 to regulate notch
      signalling.
PG  - 12126-40
AB  - CYLD, an ubiquitin hydrolase, has an expanding repertoire of regulatory roles in 
      cell signalling and is dysregulated in a number of cancers. To dissect CYLD
      function we used a proteomics approach to identify CYLD interacting proteins and 
      identified MIB2, an ubiquitin ligase enzyme involved in Notch signalling, as a
      protein which interacts with CYLD. Coexpression of CYLD and MIB2 resulted in
      stabilisation of MIB2 protein levels and was associated with reduced levels of
      JAG2, a ligand implicated in Notch signalling. Conversely, gene silencing of CYLD
      using siRNA, resulted in increased JAG2 expression and upregulation of Notch
      signalling. We investigated Notch pathway activity in skin tumours from patients 
      with germline mutations in CYLD and found that JAG2 protein levels and Notch
      target genes were upregulated. In particular, RUNX1 was overexpressed in CYLD
      defective tumour cells. Finally, primary cell cultures of CYLD defective tumours 
      demonstrated reduced viability when exposed to gamma-secretase inhibitors that
      pharmacologically target Notch signalling. Taken together these data indicate an 
      oncogenic dependency on Notch signalling and suggest potential novel therapeutic 
      approaches for patients with CYLD defective tumours.

TI  - Adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab for node-negative, HER2-positive breast
      cancer.
PG  - 134-41
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1406281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No single standard treatment exists for patients with small,
      node-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive
      breast cancers, because most of these patients have been ineligible for the
      pivotal trials of adjuvant trastuzumab. METHODS: We performed an uncontrolled,
      single-group, multicenter, investigator-initiated study of adjuvant paclitaxel
      and trastuzumab in 406 patients with tumors measuring up to 3 cm in greatest
      dimension. Patients received weekly treatment with paclitaxel and trastuzumab for
      12 weeks, followed by 9 months of trastuzumab monotherapy. The primary end point 
      was survival free from invasive disease. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was
      4.0 years. The 3-year rate of survival free from invasive disease was 98.7% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 97.6 to 99.8). Among the 12 relapses seen, 2 were due
      to distant metastatic breast cancer. Excluding contralateral HER2-negative breast
      cancers and nonbreast cancers, 7 disease-specific events were noted. A total of
      13 patients (3.2%; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.4) reported at least one episode of grade 3
      neuropathy, and 2 had symptomatic congestive heart failure (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 
      1.8), both of whom had normalization of the left ventricular ejection fraction
      after discontinuation of trastuzumab. A total of 13 patients had significant
      asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction (3.2%; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.4), as defined
      by the study, but 11 of these patients were able to resume trastuzumab therapy
      after a brief interruption. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with predominantly stage I
      HER2-positive breast cancer, treatment with adjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab 
      was associated with a risk of early recurrence of about 2%; 6% of patients
      withdrew from the study because of protocol-specified adverse events. (Funded by 
      Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00542451.).

TI  - [Prognostic significance of Ki-67 expression before and after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in different biological breast cancer phenotypes].
PG  - 671-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to analyze the Ki-67 expression before and
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and clinicopathological characteristics of
      different biological breast cancer phenotypes. The significance and prognostic
      predictive value of the changes of Ki-67 expression in different biological
      breast cancer phenotypes were analyzed. METHODS: A regression analysis was
      performed on 178 patients with invasive breast carcinoma who accepted neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital from
      August 2007 to August 2008. These patients were subtyped by hormone receptor
      status and HER-2 status. The Ki-67 index (percentage of Ki-67-positive cancer
      cell nuclei) was determined by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of
      Ki-67 index for disease-free survival (DFS) in different biological breast cancer
      phenotypes was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariable Cox
      regression. RESULTS: The overall pathologic CR (pCR) rate, defined as no invasive
      residuals in the breast and axilla, was 15.2%. The highest pCR rate of 25.0% was 
      observed in the TNBC patients, which was 14.3%, 10.3% and 18.2% in the luminal A,
      luminal B and HER2 overexpressing patients, respectively (P = 0.040). The changes
      of Ki-67 expression in pre-NAC and post-NAC patients showed a prognostic
      significance in luminal A and TNBC (P = 0.019 and P = 0.022, respectively) cases.
      Clinical stage, the efficacy of NAC, and changes of Ki-67 expression between pre-
      and post-NAC were independent prognostic factors in TNBC patients who did not
      achieve pCR. CONCLUSIONS: The Ki-67 expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is 
      an independent prognostic factor affecting the disease-free survival (DFS) in
      TNBC patients who have not achieved pCR.

TI  - PIK3CA mutations are associated with decreased benefit to neoadjuvant human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted therapies in breast cancer.
PG  - 1334-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2014.55.2158 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated whether mutations in the gene encoding the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) correlates with
      response to neoadjuvant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -targeted
      therapies in patients with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline tissue
      biopsies were available from patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who 
      were enrolled onto the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment
      Optimization trial (NeoALTTO). Activating mutations in PIK3CA were identified
      using mass spectrometry-based genotyping. RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations were
      identified in 23% of HER2-positive breast tumors, and these mutations were
      associated with poorer outcome in all of the treatment arms. Patients treated
      with a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib who had wild-type PIK3CA obtained
      a total pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of 53.1%, which decreased to
      28.6% in patients with tumors that carried PIK3CA activating mutations (P =
      .012). CONCLUSION: Activating mutations in PIK3CA predicted poor pCR in patients 
      with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapies that target
      HER2. Consequently, the combination of anti-HER2 agents and PI3K inhibitors is
      being investigated.

      HIF-1alpha stabilization.
PG  - 10151-6
AB  - 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a stable end product of lipid peroxidation, which has
      been shown to play an important role in cell signal transduction, while
      increasing cell growth and differentiation. 4-HNE could inhibit phosphatase and
      tensin homolog (PTEN) activity in hepatocytes and increased levels have been
      found in human invasive breast cancer. Here we report that 4-HNE increased the
      cell growth of breast cancer cells as revealed by colony formation assay.
      Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was elevated,
      while protein levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) were
      up-regulated. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a major mitochondria NAD+-dependent deacetylase,
      is reported to destabilize HIF-1alpha. Here, 4-HNE could inhibit the deacetylase 
      activity of SIRT3 by thiol-specific modification. We further demonstrated that
      the regulation by 4-HNE of levels of HIF-1alpha and VEGF depends on SIRT3.
      Consistent with this, 4-HNE could not increase the cell growth in SIRT3 knockdown
      breast cancer cells. Additionally, 4-HNE promoted angiogenesis and invasion of
      breast cancer cells in a SIRT3-dependent manner. In conclusion, we propose that
      4-HNE promotes growth, invasion and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells through
      the SIRT3-HIF-1alpha-VEGF axis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In women with early stage, hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR(+))
      breast cancer, the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies recurrence risk
      and predicts chemotherapy responsiveness. Recent data suggest that not all women 
      with early-stage, HR(+) disease receive this testing. We examined
      sociodemographic, clinical, and attitudinal factors associated with RS testing
      receipt and the RS testing effect on chemotherapy use in black and white
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with newly diagnosed invasive,
      nonmetastatic breast cancer were recruited and interviewed to collect
      sociocultural and health care process data; clinical data were collected from
      charts. Of the sample (n = 359), 270 had HR(+) disease. Primary analysis focused 
      on those with HR(+) node-negative disease (n = 143); secondary analyses included 
      node-positive women. Logistic regression models evaluated factors associated with
      receipt of RS testing and chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among women eligible for the
      21-gene assay, 62 patients [43%] received RS testing. In multivariable analysis, 
      older age (odds ratio, 1.04 per 1 year increase; 95% confidence interval,
      1.01-1.08) was associated with RS testing after adjustment for covariates.
      Chemotherapy use was 23%. In multivariable analysis, positive attitudes about
      chemotherapy and greater risk of recurrence were associated with chemotherapy use
      (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Patterns of genomic testing might vary according to age.
      Efforts to understand factors associated with low testing rates will be
      important.

AB  - Bone mineral density (BMD) is affected by lean body mass and body weight to
      various degrees in the course of aging. The attempt of this study is to determine
      the optimal time to begin prevention of osteoporosis. In this study, female
      hospital employees aged 20-59 years were divided into 2 age groups, 20-39 years
      and 40-59 years based on age at peak BMD, and the relations of total BMD,
      subtotal BMD and lumbar spine BMD to lean body mass and body weight were examined
      in both groups. Subtotal BMD was calculated by subtracting head BMD from total
      BMD along with whole body measurement. While persistent positive correlations
      were found among all factors in the 20-39-year-old group, subtotal BMD and lumbar
      spine BMD were positively correlated to lean body mass in the 40-59-year-old
      group. Thus, lean body mass and body weight appeared to exert a profound
      influence on subtotal BMD in those aged 20-39 years, but lean body mass in those 
      aged 40-59 years. Lean body mass appears to provide the best prediction of
      subsequent development of osteoporosis.
